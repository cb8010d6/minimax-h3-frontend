# MinimaxH3 Front

A friendly web app for generating AI video — plus, experimentally, images
and audio — with the MiniMax H3 models. **It's a frontend, not a renderer:**
it needs an existing [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/) server to actually do
the generating. This project just gives you (and anyone you invite) a
clean, simple web page to use it from — type a prompt, pick a quality
level, hit render, watch it show up in your queue — instead of wiring up
ComfyUI's node-graph editor by hand every time.

It also makes it easy to share your ComfyUI server with friends without
handing them the keys to it: they get their own login, their own private
queue and history, and never touch your actual ComfyUI setup. They can't
mess with your workflows or settings, they don't see what you're making,
and you're not stuck walking them through ComfyUI or fielding "why is it
broken" messages every time something looks unfamiliar.

Under the hood: Django (API backend) + React (SPA) + Django-Q2 (background
job queue), talking to that ComfyUI instance, all behind a single nginx
entrypoint via Docker Compose.

## Features

- **Text-to-video, image-to-video, and reference-to-video** — plus
  experimental text-to-image, reference-to-image, text-to-audio, and
  reference-to-audio modes
- **A live queue** — watch a job's progress update in real time, right in
  the sidebar, no refreshing
- **Quality/resolution/length presets** — pick a tier (e.g.
  Draft/Standard/High) instead of tuning raw sampler settings
- **Reference uploads** — click, drag-and-drop, or paste in images/audio/video
  to guide a render
- **Optional AI prompt help** — an "AI refine" button and a chat panel for
  drafting prompts, if you point it at an OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint
- **Invite-only accounts** — no open signup; log in via your own OIDC
  provider, or via admin-issued invite links
- **A per-job history** — every past render, with download/delete/redo
- **Steam Deck start video export** — a "Steam Deck video" action in a
  finished video job's "⋯ More" menu converts it to the 1280×800 VP9+Opus
  WebM format Steam Deck's custom startup-video replacement needs; pick
  the "8:5 (Steam Deck start video)" aspect ratio when generating so the
  render itself is already close to that shape
- **Separate accounts, separate renders** — everyone only ever sees their
  own queue and history, never anyone else's jobs or prompts
- **Director Mode** — a video-editor-style board for sequencing multiple
  clips into one longer video: chain clips together for seamless
  motion/audio continuity between them, share a project-wide prompt and
  reference images/voice/style across every clip, generate a first draft
  of the whole sequence from a pasted script or idea, and export the
  finished sequence as one downloadable video once every clip is
  rendered. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#director-mode).

## Quick start

You'll need:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) + Docker Compose
- A running [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/) instance, reachable from
  wherever Docker runs (see
  [`resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md`](resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md) for how
  that connection works) — ComfyUI itself is **not** part of this stack,
  you bring your own
- That ComfyUI instance already set up to run the official MiniMax H3
  workflows — see [Required ComfyUI models](#required-comfyui-models) below
  for exactly which model files that means

**1. Get the code.**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheTerrasque/minimax-h3-frontend.git
cd minimax-h3-frontend
```

(No git? Use GitHub's "Code → Download ZIP" button instead and extract it.)

**2. Configure it.**

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set at least `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and
`COMFYUI_BASE_URL` (everything else has a working default — see
[Configuration](#configuration) below for the full list).

**3. Start it.**

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

This builds and starts everything — Postgres, migrations, Django, the
Django-Q2 worker, and the nginx-fronted frontend — and serves the app at
**http://localhost:8080/**.

**4. Create your admin account.**

```sh
docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Log into `/admin/` with it to:

- review/adjust the quality presets (`RenderPreset`/`RenderDuration` rows —
  per-mode quality tiers like Draft/Standard/High and their selectable clip
  lengths). A reasonable starter set is already seeded, with rough
  unbenchmarked render-time estimates you can refine later via
  `manage.py benchmark_render_times`.
- create an [Invite](#accounts--invites) for anyone else who should get an
  account — its shareable URL is `/invite/<token>/`

**That's it.** Open **http://localhost:8080/**, log in, and start queuing
renders. (For interactive, auto-generated API docs instead, there's also
**http://localhost:8080/api/schema/swagger-ui/** — log in via
`/accounts/login/` first, in another tab, since the endpoints require a
session.)

## Accounts & invites

There is no open signup. Two ways to get an account:

- **A configured OIDC server is itself the trust gate** — if you set the
  `OIDC_*` variables below, anyone who can successfully log in through that
  identity provider gets an account automatically (you already control who
  has credentials there). Set `OIDC_AUTO_SIGNUP=false` if you'd rather
  require an invite even for OIDC logins (e.g. the IdP isn't a closed set of
  pre-approved people).
- **Everyone else needs an admin-issued invite** — create one from the
  in-app admin page at `/manage` (visible in the nav to any staff user) or
  from Django admin at `/admin/`, then send the person its
  `/invite/<token>/` URL. Opening that link sends them to a local
  email/password signup form (`/accounts/signup/`); completing it is what
  actually creates their account, and the token is single-use (locked to a
  specific email too, if the invite was created with one). `/manage` also
  lists existing invites (active/redeemed/expired) with copy-link and
  revoke actions.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Backend apps" section for the full rationale.

## Configuration

All configuration is environment variables, set in `.env` (copy
`.env.example` to start) and consumed by every backend-image-based service
(`backend`, `qcluster`, `migrate`) via Docker Compose's `env_file:`.

### Postgres

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `mm_h3` | Database name. |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `mm_h3` | Database user. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `mm_h3` | Database password — **change this**, the default is only for local/throwaway use. |
| `DB_HOST` | `db` | Database hostname. Leave as `db` (the Compose service name) unless pointing at an external Postgres. |
| `DB_PORT` | `5432` | Database port. |

### Django core

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | *(insecure placeholder)* | Django's cryptographic signing key. Generate a real one: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))"`. Treat it as a secret. |
| `DJANGO_DEBUG` | `false` | Verbose error pages when `true`. Keep `false` except while actively debugging — it leaks internals. |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `localhost,127.0.0.1` | Comma-separated hostnames Django will accept requests for. Must include whatever host you actually browse to. |
| `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:8080,http://127.0.0.1:8080` | Comma-separated full origins (scheme+host+port) allowed to make unsafe (POST/etc.) requests. Must include **every** origin you actually load the SPA from — e.g. both `http://localhost:8080` and `http://127.0.0.1:8080` if you (or anyone else) might use either; Django checks the browser's `Origin` header against this list exactly, so one hostname doesn't cover another that resolves to the same machine. Missing one here 403s with "CSRF verification failed" on every POST, including login. |
| `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` | `false` | Redirect plain HTTP to HTTPS. Only turn on once this is actually served over HTTPS (e.g. behind a Kubernetes Ingress with a real cert). |
| `DJANGO_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Only send the session cookie over HTTPS. Same "only once HTTPS is real" caveat as above. |
| `DJANGO_CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Only send the CSRF cookie over HTTPS. Same caveat. |
| `DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` | `0` | Seconds browsers should refuse plain HTTP for this host after one HTTPS response. `0` = off. Only set once every subdomain you'd ever serve here is HTTPS-only too, and only after `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=true` has been running fine for a while — it's a browser-cached promise that's hard to walk back early. |

### ComfyUI

See [`resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md`](resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md) for how this integration works.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `COMFYUI_BASE_URL` | `http://host.docker.internal:8000` | Base URL of the ComfyUI instance to submit jobs to. `host.docker.internal` reaches the Docker *host* machine (e.g. ComfyUI Desktop running alongside this stack); point it at any reachable host:port instead if ComfyUI runs elsewhere (as it does in this project's own deployment — a separate GPU machine on the LAN). |
| `COMFYUI_OUTPUT_ROOT` | *(empty)* | Absolute filesystem path to ComfyUI's `output/` folder, if reachable from this machine — used to delete a generated video from ComfyUI's disk right after downloading it, so it doesn't linger there. Leave blank to skip that cleanup step (ComfyUI just keeps every output forever on its own disk). |
| `COMFYUI_EXTRAS` | *(empty)* | Optional ComfyUI extras (mostly third-party custom nodes, one native) — see [`docs/extras.md`](docs/extras.md). Comma-separated `slug` or `slug=N` tokens (`N` in 0/1/2 — optional-off, optional-on-by-default, forced). `spectrum` and `turbo` both do something, e.g. `COMFYUI_EXTRAS=spectrum=1,turbo`. |
| `COMFYUI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `15` | Read timeout (seconds) for ComfyUI's short-lived JSON endpoints (`/history`, `/queue`, `/object_info`, `/interrupt`, etc.) — *not* the upload/download calls, which already scale their own timeout with payload size. Raise this if jobs occasionally fail with `Read timed out` even though ComfyUI is reachable — a busy/loaded GPU host can be slow to answer a poll without actually being down. |
| `TURBO_STEPS_T2V_I2V` | `8` | Sampler steps for a turbo t2v/i2v job — see [`docs/extras.md#turbo`](docs/extras.md#turbo). Only relevant when `turbo` is in `COMFYUI_EXTRAS`. |
| `TURBO_STEPS_R2V` | `4` | Same as above, for r2v/r2i/r2a jobs — r2v's turbo LoRA was trained at a different step count than t2v/i2v's. |

### Dynamic GPU workers (optional)

The H3 scheduler can discover and lease multiple GPUs instead of treating one
ComfyUI endpoint as a global singleton. Set `GPU_WORKER_HOSTS` to the SSH
aliases (or host names) that run ComfyUI, and install the repository's
`ops/comfy_workerctl.py` on each host. The scheduler invokes that controller
over SSH for `inventory`, `start`, `unload`, `cleanup`, and `stop` actions;
the SSH account needs permission to run `nvidia-smi`, start ComfyUI, and reach
the per-GPU loopback ports.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GPU_WORKER_HOSTS` | `gpu01,gpu02` | Comma-separated SSH targets. Every detected GPU is considered; cards with unmanaged compute processes are skipped. |
| `GPU_WORKER_PORT_BASE` | `18100` | Per-GPU ComfyUI port base; GPU index `N` uses `base + N`. |
| `GPU_WORKER_SSH_BIN` | `ssh` | SSH executable used by Django. |
| `GPU_WORKER_CONTROLLER` | `/opt/minimax-h3/ops/comfy_workerctl.py` | Absolute path to the controller on each GPU host. Copy `ops/comfy_workerctl.py` there or set this to your deployment path. |
| `GPU_MODEL_IDLE_SECONDS` | `180` | Seconds a confirmed warm model may remain idle before the scheduler unloads it. |
| `GPU_AVAILABLE_MODELS` | `fl2va:fp8,fl2va:int8,ref2va:fp8,ref2va:int8` | Model keys exposed to the UI. Keep this list in sync with the files installed on the GPU hosts. |

The controller is intentionally environment-driven so the open-source default
does not assume a particular home directory. On each GPU host, set
`MINIMAX_H3_ROOT`, `COMFYUI_ROOT`, `COMFYUI_PYTHON`, `COMFYUI_START_SCRIPT`,
`COMFYUI_LOG_ROOT`, `COMFYUI_RUNTIME_DATA_ROOT`, and `COMFYUI_PORT_BASE` when
your filesystem differs from the documented `/opt` defaults. Its `inventory`
action is safe to run as a smoke test before enabling the scheduler:

```sh
python3 /opt/minimax-h3/ops/comfy_workerctl.py inventory
```

### LLM prompt-assist (optional)

Entirely optional — leave `LLM_API_BASE_URL`/`LLM_MODEL` blank and no AI
features (the "AI refine" button, the prompt chat) are offered at all; the
app works fine without an LLM configured.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_API_BASE_URL` | *(empty)* | Base URL of any OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint. Required (with `LLM_MODEL`) to enable AI features. |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | API key for that endpoint, if it needs one. **Optional** — many self-hosted servers (llama.cpp server, LM Studio, text-generation-webui, vLLM in permissive mode) don't require one; leave blank and no `Authorization` header is sent at all. |
| `LLM_MODEL` | *(empty)* | Model name to request. Required (with `LLM_API_BASE_URL`) to enable AI features. |
| `LLM_VISION_ENABLED` | `false` | When `true`, the chat feature sends actual reference image bytes to the LLM as vision content (not just their `<Picture N>` labels). Only turn this on if `LLM_MODEL` is genuinely vision-capable *and* the server actually has vision support loaded — a text/vision-capable model architecture running on a server without its vision-projector loaded will accept the request but the model won't actually see the images (confirmed hitting exactly this with a real test image against this project's own configured model — it works, but doesn't have vision loaded, so this stays `false` here). |

### OIDC login

Optional — leave `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` blank to run without OIDC configured yet (you can still create accounts manually via `createsuperuser` or invites, once another login method exists).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME` | `OIDC` | Human-readable label shown for this login option. |
| `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` | *(empty)* | The OIDC provider's issuer URL (its discovery document lives at `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`). |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | *(empty)* | OAuth client ID registered with that provider. |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | *(empty)* | OAuth client secret. |
| `OIDC_AUTO_SIGNUP` | `true` | `true`: completing OIDC login alone creates an account, no invite needed. `false`: OIDC logins need a valid invite too, same as any other new signup. |

### Email (optional)

Local signup ("optional" email verification) and password-reset both send a
confirmation email. Leave `EMAIL_HOST` blank and these just get printed to
the container's logs instead of actually sent — fine for local/invite-only
use. **Without a real EMAIL_HOST or that fallback, Django defaults to real
SMTP against `localhost:25`, which crashes the request with a 500 the moment
nothing's listening there — after the account was already created.**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `EMAIL_HOST` | *(empty)* | SMTP server hostname. Leave blank to print emails to the logs instead of sending them. |
| `EMAIL_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port. |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | *(empty)* | SMTP username. |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | SMTP password. |
| `EMAIL_USE_TLS` | `true` | Use STARTTLS when talking to the SMTP server. |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | `webmaster@localhost` | The `From:` address on outgoing emails. |

### Background jobs

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Q_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT` | `3600` | Hard wall-clock kill (seconds) of the worker process if a single render runs longer than this. Raise it if renders on your hardware/models routinely run long — the old 1200s default was already too tight for a genuine ~20 minute render (see `settings.py`'s `Q_CLUSTER` comment). |

Worker count (Django-Q2) is hardcoded to 1, not configurable — jobs are processed strictly one at a time, FIFO (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s `tasks.py` bullet); raising it would let multiple jobs render in parallel, breaking that guarantee (and ComfyUI itself only renders one job at a time regardless, so there's no throughput to gain).

## Useful commands

```sh
# tail logs
docker compose logs -f backend qcluster

# Django shell (inspect/create objects directly)
docker compose exec backend python manage.py shell

# sweep (resolution, duration) combinations against the real ComfyUI to
# find what's actually viable and how long it takes -- spends real GPU
# time and can crash ComfyUI on oversized combinations by design (that's
# the point); see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's "Benchmarking render times"
docker compose exec backend python manage.py benchmark_render_times --help

# check whether COMFYUI_EXTRAS' ComfyUI-side custom nodes are actually
# installed on the configured ComfyUI instance -- see docs/extras.md
docker compose exec backend python manage.py check_extras

# generate thumbnails for existing done video jobs that don't have one yet
# (new jobs get one automatically) -- idempotent, safe to re-run. The
# migrate service tries this automatically already; run it manually here
# if that didn't work (e.g. migrate has no media volume access in your setup)
docker compose exec backend python manage.py backfill_thumbnails
```

## Required ComfyUI models

This project's `resources/workflows/` graphs (see below) are ComfyUI's
official [day-0 MiniMax H3 support](https://blog.comfy.org/p/minimax-h3-day-0-support-in-comfyui)
— that post is the best source for what the model can actually do and how
the workflow is put together. The model weights themselves are on
[Hugging Face — Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3).

Download these into your ComfyUI instance's usual model folders before
pointing this project at it:

| Model file | Type | Folder |
|---|---|---|
| `minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors` | Diffusion model (text-to-video / image-to-video) | `models/diffusion_models/` |
| `minimax_h3_ref2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors` | Diffusion model (reference-to-video) | `models/diffusion_models/` |
| `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors` | Video VAE | `models/vae/` |
| `minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors` | Audio VAE | `models/vae/` |
| `qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_nvfp4_awq.safetensors` | Text encoder | `models/text_encoders/` (`models/clip/` on older ComfyUI versions) |

This project doesn't provide or download these itself — that list is just
what `resources/workflows_api/*.json` actually reference; check those files
yourself if a future model update changes the exact filenames.

Optional, only needed if you enable `turbo` in `COMFYUI_EXTRAS` (see
[`docs/extras.md#turbo`](docs/extras.md#turbo)) — two LoRAs into
`models/loras/`:

| Model file | Used by |
|---|---|
| `minimax_h3_fl2v_turbo_8step_v1.0_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` | Text-to-video / image-to-video |
| `minimax_h3_ref2v_turbo_4step_v0.1_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` | Reference-to-video |

## Updating the ComfyUI workflows

There are only **three** underlying ComfyUI graphs, all in
[`resources/workflows/`](resources/workflows/):

| File | Mode(s) it drives |
|---|---|
| `video_minimax_h3_t2v.json` | Text-to-video, **and** the experimental text-to-image / text-to-audio modes |
| `video_minimax_h3_i2v.json` | Image-to-video |
| `video_minimax_h3_r2v.json` | Reference-to-video, **and** the experimental reference-to-image / reference-to-audio modes |

The image/audio modes don't have workflows of their own — they submit the
*same* t2v/r2v graph, then [`integrations/media_post.py`](backend/integrations/media_post.py)
uses ffmpeg to pull a still frame or the audio track out of the rendered
video. So editing `video_minimax_h3_t2v.json` also changes what text-to-image
and text-to-audio produce, and likewise for `video_minimax_h3_r2v.json` /
reference-to-image / reference-to-audio.

To change a workflow (swap a model, tweak default sampler settings, rewire
nodes, etc.):

1. Open the relevant `resources/workflows/*.json` file in ComfyUI's own UI
   (drag it in, or File → Open) and make your changes there. Save it back
   over the same file.
2. Regenerate its API-format counterpart — what `POST /prompt` actually
   consumes — by re-running the exporter **on your host machine** (not
   `docker compose exec`: `resources/` isn't bind-mounted into the
   containers, it's baked into the image at build time, so anything written
   inside a running container is invisible to the host and gone the next
   time that container is rebuilt/recreated). Needs the `backend/.venv` set
   up (`uv sync`, from `backend/`) and a **reachable ComfyUI instance** (it
   needs live `/object_info` for any node type not already cached under
   `backend/scripts/object_info_cache/`):

   ```sh
   cd backend
   # COMFYUI_BASE_URL defaults to http://comfyui:8188 if unset -- override it
   # to wherever ComfyUI is reachable *from your host* (not
   # host.docker.internal -- that name only resolves from inside a container)
   COMFYUI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8188 uv run python scripts/export_workflow_api.py \
     ../resources/workflows/video_minimax_h3_t2v.json \
     ../resources/workflows_api/video_minimax_h3_t2v.api.json
   ```

   Repeat for `_i2v_`/`_r2v_` as needed. This overwrites the matching file
   in `resources/workflows_api/` on your host — that's the file actually
   read at render time (`generation/tasks.py`). If a node's inputs changed
   shape (new params, renamed sockets), delete the stale entry (or the whole
   folder) under `backend/scripts/object_info_cache/` first so the exporter
   re-fetches it.
3. Rebuild and recreate the backend + qcluster containers so the updated
   `.api.json` actually gets baked into their image (a plain `restart`
   does **not** pick it up — same reason as step 2, nothing is bind-mounted):
   `docker compose build backend qcluster && docker compose up -d`.

**One caveat:** `generation/tasks.py` patches a handful of *specific node
IDs* in each `.api.json` after loading it (prompt, resolution, steps,
duration, seed, reference images/audio — see `_T2V_I2V_NODES`/`_R2V_NODES`
near the top of that file). Tweaking existing nodes' settings/values is
always safe — the exporter and `tasks.py` don't care what a node's
*defaults* are, only where the ones it patches live. But if you delete,
replace, or rewire one of those specific nodes (or otherwise change the
graph structure around them), you'll need to update the matching node ID
constants in `generation/tasks.py` to match, or job submission will patch
the wrong node (or crash). See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Getting the
workflows working" section for the full technical rationale (including how
the exporter itself works) and `resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md` for the
ComfyUI API this all targets.

## Project structure

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full breakdown. Briefly:

```
backend/       Django API (uv-managed) -- accounts, generation, integrations
frontend/      React SPA (Vite + TS), served by nginx in front of everything
resources/     Product brief, ComfyUI workflows + API guide, prompt-writing guides
docs/          Architecture writeup, function-check procedure, ComfyUI extras
docker-compose.yml   The whole stack: db, migrate, backend, qcluster, frontend
```

## Status

Verified end-to-end against a real ComfyUI instance — log in, queue a job,
watch it render live, download the result — not just written and assumed
to work. See [`docs/FUNCTION_CHECK.md`](docs/FUNCTION_CHECK.md) for the
repeatable procedure that confirms this yourself.

Known rough edges:

- `RenderPreset.estimated_render_seconds` values are seeded guesses, not
  yet benchmarked for real — run `manage.py benchmark_render_times` to
  tune them for your own hardware (see [Useful commands](#useful-commands)).
- A few deferred pieces don't have a frontend yet — see
  [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)'s "Deferred" section for
  exactly what's built vs. not.
