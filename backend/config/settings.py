# processed strictly one at a time, FIFO (see generation/tasks.py's
# process_queue()/module docstring) -- that ordering and one-at-a-time-ness
# is enforced there by an explicit DB claim query, not by Django-Q2 itself
# (its ORM broker's dequeue has no ORDER BY, so task pickup order isn't
# otherwise guaranteed), but a second worker slot would let two *different*
# jobs run in parallel regardless of claim order, which the DB-level row
# locking alone doesn't prevent. Don't raise this without redesigning that.
#
# "timeout" is a hard wall-clock kill of the worker process, unrelated to
# any timeout inside generation/tasks.py/integrations/comfyui.py (those
# just make _execute_job() return -- they can't stop Django-Q2 from
# reincarnating the worker mid-render if this is too low). It has to
# comfortably exceed a single render's worst case, not just its estimate:
# _execute_job() waits up to job.estimated_seconds * 3 + 300, and
# estimated_seconds is seeded from rough, mostly-unbenchmarked guesses (see
# generation/migrations/0009_seed_resolution_duration_catalog.py) that can
# run long in practice -- a real ~20 minute render already tripped the old
# 1200s default. Raise via env if your hardware/models are slower still.
# "retry" must stay above "timeout" (Django-Q2 raises at startup otherwise)
# with headroom for the ORM broker's own polling latency, so it's derived
