    "if you want live progress" note): preparing (model loading, pre-nodes),
    rendering (the sampler's steps), finishing (VAE decode/encode, disk
    write). phase is one of "preparing"/"rendering"/"finishing"; current/max
    are only non-None during "rendering" (the sampler's own `progress`
    messages -- step reached / total steps).

    Phase is inferred purely from node-execution order relative to
    sampler_node_id, the only node id whose semantic meaning we actually
    know here: every node ComfyUI executes before we've seen the sampler
    node counts as "preparing", the sampler node itself is "rendering",
    anything executed after it is "finishing".

    This is a best-effort side channel purely for progress display -- NOT
    the source of truth for success/failure or for the actual output.
    Callers must always separately call wait_for_result() + check_for_error()
    regardless of how this returns; this function returns (without raising)
    as soon as the prompt reports fully done (`executing` with node=None),
    reports an execution_error or execution_interrupted (letting the
    caller's own /history check produce the real error/cancellation
    handling, so there's only one place that formats it), or on any
    connection problem/timeout -- swallowing its own exceptions rather than
    propagating them, since losing live progress is fine but failing the
    whole job over a WebSocket hiccup would not be.

    cancel_check, if given, is polled roughly once a second (same as the
    receive-timeout cadence below) -- lets this return promptly on a
    cancel_job() request instead of sitting in recv() for up to `timeout`
    waiting on a prompt that may never send another message (e.g. it was
    dequeued before ComfyUI ever started executing it).
