"""ffmpeg post-processing of a ComfyUI video render into a still frame or
an audio-only file -- see generation/models.py's Mode docstring: the
image/audio modes reuse the same video workflows as t2v/r2v (there's no
native image- or audio-only ComfyUI graph for this model) and derive their
actual output from that rendered video via these two functions, called
from generation/tasks.py's _finish_job_from_history().

Verified against real ComfyUI renders (not just synthetic test files) --
see git history for the manual verification this was built against: a
5-frame (near-zero duration) render at normal resolution produces a fully
coherent frame 0 despite the model's width/height/length node schema
tooltip calling that frame count "untested" (trained range ~124-362); a
32x32 render at 10 steps still produces real, non-silent audio.
