"""Generates GenerationJob.thumbnail_file for existing done video-content-
type jobs that don't have one yet -- see integrations/media_post.extract_thumbnail()
and generation/tasks.py's _finish_job_from_history() (the normal, per-job
path new renders already go through).

Needs real access to the actual media files -- run this against a container
that has the media volume mounted (backend/qcluster do; the one-shot
`migrate` service may not, depending on deployment -- see
docker-compose.yml's migrate service comment). Idempotent and safe to
re-run anytime: only touches jobs with thumbnail_file still blank, and a
failure on one job (missing/corrupt video file, ffmpeg error) never affects
any other -- just gets logged and skipped.

Usage:
    docker compose exec backend python manage.py backfill_thumbnails
    docker compose exec backend python manage.py backfill_thumbnails --dry-run
