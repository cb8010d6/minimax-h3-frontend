"""Diagnostic: checks whether each extra configured via COMFYUI_EXTRAS (see
extras.md, config/settings.py's EXTRAS_CONFIG) actually has its ComfyUI-side
node(s) installed on the configured ComfyUI instance right now. Doesn't
touch the render path at all -- purely a "did I actually install the custom
node yet" sanity check to run after flipping COMFYUI_EXTRAS on and before
queuing a real job with it.

Also unconditionally checks Director Mode's continuity extension (see
extras.md#contex-loop) -- unlike the extras above, that one isn't gated by
COMFYUI_EXTRAS/EXTRAS_CONFIG at all (there's no per-job toggle to show; a
continues_previous clip just uses it automatically when available and
falls back to a simpler technique when not, see director/services.py), so
it's checked every run regardless of COMFYUI_EXTRAS.

Usage:
    uv run manage.py check_extras
