"""Django-Q2 task entry point for working through the GenerationJob queue.

Registered by calling async_task("generation.tasks.process_queue") (no job
id -- each invocation atomically claims at most one FIFO job) whenever a job
is created (see generation/api.py). Multiple process_queue() calls may run in
parallel. Each atomically claims the oldest unlocked queued job and then
leases one unlocked, system-idle physical GPU through gpu_scheduler. This
allows up to one render per available GPU while preventing two jobs from
sharing a card. If every GPU is leased or occupied by an external compute
process, the job remains queued until a worker is released.

No LLM call happens here -- prompt refinement is an explicit pre-job user
action (the "AI refine" button or the interactive chat, both in
generation/api.py); by the time a job reaches _execute_job(), its
improved_prompt already holds whatever the user ended up with (or is blank,
meaning they didn't use either).

The three API-format workflows this patches live in
resources/workflows_api/*.api.json, generated from resources/workflows/*.json
by scripts/export_workflow_api.py (a from-scratch reimplementation of
ComfyUI's own "Export API" -- see that script's docstring for exactly how
each serialization rule was verified against real saved workflow JSON + live
/object_info responses; nothing about the node ids below is guessed). If a
workflow in resources/workflows/ is ever edited in the ComfyUI UI, re-run
that script to regenerate its .api.json counterpart before this will still
line up.

build_api_workflow() below is deliberately a pure function (given already-
uploaded ComfyUI filenames, no DB/network I/O of its own) so it's reusable
by both this module's job-backed _execute_job() and
generation/management/commands/benchmark_render_times.py, which needs the
same patching without any GenerationJob/RenderPreset DB rows to back it.

    without this, a PROCESSING job orphaned this way would sit stuck
    forever, showing "Processing…" to its owner indefinitely (see
    ARCHITECTURE.md's Verification for the real report this came from).

    It is called only by recover_stale_jobs immediately before qcluster starts
    consuming work. No local worker can still own a PROCESSING row at that
    point, so all such rows are orphaned even with many concurrent workers.

    DO NOT call this (or _recover_one_orphaned_job) ad hoc against a live
    stack's real database -- e.g. from `manage.py shell` while qcluster is
    running -- outside those two call sites. Nothing stops it from racing
    a genuinely in-flight _execute_job() for some *other* job than the one
    you're looking at: it queries every PROCESSING row with no locking, so
    it will happily "recover" (and, if the ComfyUI client is mocked for a
    test, incorrectly mark failed) a job a live worker is still actively
    rendering. Hit this for real: an ad hoc test run with `comfyui` mocked
    swept up a real, genuinely-still-rendering job alongside the intended
    synthetic test rows and marked it lost mid-render -- see
    ARCHITECTURE.md's Verification for the full incident and recovery.

    Tries to actually recover the result rather than just discarding
    progress: checks ComfyUI's /history first (it may have finished while
    nothing was watching), then /queue (it may genuinely still be
    rendering, in which case this picks the wait back up rather than
    abandoning it), and only gives up -- marking the job DONE with an
    explanatory error, freeing it from blocking anything -- once ComfyUI
    has no record of it at all.
