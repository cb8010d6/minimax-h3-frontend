"""Aspect-ratio -> pixel-resolution math, replicating the ResolutionSelector
node's own logic (megapixels + aspect ratio -> width/height, rounded to a
multiple) -- see resources/workflows/*.json. We bypass that node entirely in
generation/tasks.py::build_api_workflow() (it only accepts an aspect-ratio
preset + megapixels widget, not arbitrary literal width/height, and we need
to set literal width/height there), so this is our own reimplementation of
"pick pixel dimensions from megapixels + ratio" for the API/frontend layer.

Unlike megapixels (which determines render time -- see RenderPreset), aspect
ratio does not meaningfully affect render time for a fixed pixel count, so
it's kept as a small fixed enum here rather than a DB-backed model: it's
orthogonal to the RenderPreset/RenderDuration catalog, not another axis of
things worth benchmarking.
