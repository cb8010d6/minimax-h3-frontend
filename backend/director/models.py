"""Director Mode: chaining multiple GenerationJob renders into one ordered
sequence of Clips, with a shared Project-level prompt/resources and
motion-continuity between adjacent Clips flagged as continuations of each
other (see integrations/motion_context.py, extras.md). See the approved
plan for the full design -- this module is deliberately just the data model
+ dirty-cascade rule; rendering itself lives in services.py/tasks.py and the
API surface in api.py, kept separate so this stays easy to read on its own.

Layering: this app depends on generation (GenerationJob, RenderPreset,
RenderDuration, Mode, ReferenceAsset's Kind/label convention) -- generation
never imports director, see apps.py's ready()/signals.py for the one seam
that runs the other way (a Django signal, not an import).
