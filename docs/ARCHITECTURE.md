# Architecture

Friendly web frontend for the MiniMax H3 ComfyUI video workflows in
[`resources/workflows/`](../resources/workflows/) — see
[`resources/features.md`](../resources/features.md) for the product brief and
[`resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md`](../resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md) for how the
backend talks to ComfyUI. This document describes the structure/architecture
scaffold built for it: what exists, why it's shaped this way, and what's
deliberately not built yet.

## Why a single nginx entrypoint (and why that means no CORS/JWT)

`frontend`'s nginx container is the **only** service that publishes a host
port. It serves the built SPA at `/` and reverse-proxies `/api/`,
`/accounts/`, `/admin/`, `/invite/`, `/static/`, `/media/` straight to the
`backend` container (see
[`frontend/nginx.conf.template`](../frontend/nginx.conf.template)). The
browser therefore only ever talks to one origin.

**Routing gotcha, worth remembering before adding SPA routes**: nginx's
proxy rule is a prefix match on `^/(api|accounts|admin|invite|static|media)/`,
so any SPA route starting with one of those segments — e.g. a naive
`/admin` page — would be silently swallowed by that rule and handed to
Django's own admin site before React Router ever sees it. This is why the
in-app admin page lives at **`/manage`** instead of `/admin` (see
`accounts`/"Frontend" below) — pick a prefix outside that set for any
future SPA route too.

That's what makes plain **Django session-cookie auth** viable for the SPA:
allauth's OIDC callback sets a session cookie, and `src/api/client.ts` just
sends `credentials: 'include'` plus the CSRF header read from the
`csrftoken` cookie on unsafe methods — no CORS configuration, no JWT issuing
or storage. If a bare `manage.py runserver` + separate Vite dev server is
ever used outside Docker, that's the one setup where CORS would start
mattering — out of scope here since this pass is Docker-first.

**Known nginx gotchas, hit and fixed during setup:**

- **Stale backend IP after a rebuild.** nginx resolves a plain
  `proxy_pass http://backend:8000;` hostname once at startup and caches
  it — so whenever the `backend` container gets recreated (any
  rebuild/redeploy), its Docker-internal IP changes and nginx keeps
  proxying to the old, dead address (502s) until nginx itself restarts.
  Fixed in `nginx.conf.template` by resolving `backend` through Docker
  Compose's embedded DNS (`resolver 127.0.0.11`, or
  `${NGINX_LOCAL_RESOLVERS}` — auto-detected at container start, see
  `frontend/Dockerfile`) via a variable on every request instead, so
  `frontend` no longer needs restarting after a `backend` rebuild —
  verified by force-recreating `backend` alone and confirming `frontend`
  picked up the new IP with zero manual intervention.
- **Upload size cap.** nginx's own default `client_max_body_size` is 1MB,
  far below what `POST /api/jobs/` needs once reference uploads are
  involved (r2v/r2i/r2a take up to 9 images + 3 audio clips in one
  multipart request, see "Backend apps" above) — every such submission was
  rejected with a `413` **by nginx itself**, before the request ever
  reached Django (Django's own `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` doesn't apply
  here — its docs explicitly exclude file upload data from that check — so
  nginx's default was the only thing actually capping it). Fixed with
  `client_max_body_size 500m;` on the proxied location in
  `nginx.conf.template`; verified by posting real multi-file multipart
  bodies (a plain 2MB file, then a combined ~22MB two-file r2v-shaped
  request) straight through nginx and confirming they now reach Django (a
  `403` for lacking a session, not a `413`) instead of being rejected at
  the proxy.
- **X-Forwarded-Proto trust.** nginx used to pass through whatever
  `X-Forwarded-Proto` a client sent, which Django's
  `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` would then trust unconditionally — letting a
  plain-HTTP client spoof "https" and bypass `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`
  once that's turned on. Fixed by defaulting to nginx's own connection
  scheme instead; set `NGINX_TRUST_FORWARDED_PROTO=true` only when this
  container is guaranteed to sit behind another hop (e.g. a Kubernetes
  Ingress) that overwrites the header itself. See
  `frontend/nginx.conf.template`'s own comment for the full reasoning.

## Docker Compose service graph

- **`db`** — Postgres. Two separate processes (`backend`, `qcluster`) hit the
  same database concurrently, which is why it's Postgres and not SQLite.
- **`migrate`** — one-shot, runs `manage.py migrate`, then exits. `backend`
  and `qcluster` both wait on `db: service_healthy` and
  `migrate: service_completed_successfully`, so migrations always land
  before anything tries to use the schema.
- **`backend`** — Django via gunicorn. Not published to the host — only
  reachable through the nginx proxy and from `qcluster` on the compose
  network. Serves static files itself via whitenoise; serves `/media/`
  (uploaded reference assets + generated videos) directly too via an
  explicit mount in `config/urls.py` (unconditional, not gated on `DEBUG`
  unlike Django's own dev-only static-serving helper), through
  `generation.media_views.serve_protected_media` rather than a bare
  `django.views.static.serve` — see "Verification" below for why and how.
  **This was a real, live bug**: that mount didn't exist at all for a
  while, so every `video_url` the API returned 404'd —
  `django.contrib.staticfiles` never auto-serves `MEDIA_ROOT` (only
  `STATIC_ROOT`), and there's no DEBUG-gated fallback for media, so it was
  simply never reachable until wired up explicitly. Found via a user
  report and reverified with a real download through nginx.
  **Second and third real bugs, both also from user reports**: the mount
  that fixed the first bug had no authentication or per-user access
  control at all, and what it served had predictable filenames — combined,
  any generated video or reference upload from any user could be found and
  downloaded by anyone who could reach the app, logged in or not. Confirmed
  concretely before fixing anything: stored video filenames were ComfyUI's
  own literal, sequential output names (`MiniMax_H3_00324_.mp4` → `00325` →
  `00326` → …, trivially walkable by incrementing a counter), and reference
  filenames were the uploader's original filename verbatim (e.g. a phone
  camera's `20230625_092948.jpg`). Fixed both: filenames first
  (`GenerationJob.video_file`/`ReferenceAsset.file` now use a callable
  `upload_to` — `generated_video_upload_path`/`reference_upload_path` in
  `generation/models.py` — discarding the original filename entirely
  except a sanitized extension, replacing it with a random UUID), then
  actual access control (`serve_protected_media`, see "Verification"
  below) — flagged as a separate, larger change and confirmed wanted
  before building it, since an unguessable name alone only removes the
  easiest way to exploit the missing access control, it doesn't add any.
  (One residual gap, not fixed: this only changes the path used for *new*
  uploads/access checks going forward — files already stored under their
  old, predictable names keep those names unless separately renamed; not
  done this pass.)
- **`qcluster`** — same image as `backend`, running
  `manage.py recover_stale_jobs && manage.py qcluster` — the recovery
  command first re-queues any job left stuck `processing` by a previous
  `qcluster` restart (see `recover_orphaned_processing_jobs()` in
  `tasks.py`), then starts the Django-Q2 worker that executes
  `generation.tasks.process_queue`. Pinned to a single worker (hardcoded
  `"workers": 1` in `settings.py`'s `Q_CLUSTER`, timeout configurable via
  `Q_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT`) so jobs render strictly one at a time, FIFO — see
  `tasks.py`'s bullet under "Backend apps" for why that's enforced at the
  DB-query level, not by Django-Q2's own worker count.
- **`frontend`** — `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged`, running as a non-root
  user (so it satisfies Kubernetes' "restricted" Pod Security Standard with
  no `securityContext` workarounds); the stack's one published port
  (`8080:8080` by default — the container itself listens on 8080, an
  unprivileged port, not 80).

`backend`/`qcluster` get `extra_hosts: host.docker.internal:host-gateway` so
a `COMFYUI_BASE_URL` pointed at the Docker *host* itself (e.g. ComfyUI
Desktop on the same machine, default `http://host.docker.internal:8000`)
resolves the same way on Linux Docker as it does out-of-the-box on Docker
Desktop. **ComfyUI itself is not containerized** either way. In this
deployment specifically, ComfyUI runs on a separate networked GPU machine
(an RTX 3090 box on the LAN, hostname `gpusun`, portable ComfyUI 0.30.0 —
not literally "Desktop") reachable on port `8188`. `.env`'s
`COMFYUI_BASE_URL` uses that machine's **IP address directly**
(`http://192.168.31.71:8188`), not the `gpusun` hostname — hit this for
real: `gpusun`/`gpusun.lan` resolves fine from the Docker host (Windows)
via its own NetBIOS/mDNS resolution, but the backend/qcluster containers got
`NameResolutionError` on that exact same hostname, since Docker's embedded
DNS doesn't do that kind of resolution. If this stack ever moves to a
network where `gpusun`'s IP isn't stable, an `extra_hosts` entry on
`backend`/`qcluster` (same mechanism as `host.docker.internal` above) would
be the more durable fix. `host.docker.internal` itself isn't used in this
deployment but is kept as the documented default for the common
same-machine case.

Config is env-driven (`django-environ`), via `.env` → `env_file:` for every
backend-image-based service. See `.env.example` for the full list
(Postgres creds, `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`/`DEBUG`/`ALLOWED_HOSTS`,
`CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, HTTPS/reverse-proxy settings
(`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`/`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`/`CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`/
`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`), ComfyUI/LLM endpoints, OIDC settings, email
settings (falls back to the console backend when `EMAIL_HOST` is unset),
`Q_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT`) — this is also how features.md
item 12 ("Endpoints for comfyui and llm should be configured in django
settings") is satisfied.

## Backend apps

**`accounts`** — custom `User(AbstractUser)` (`AUTH_USER_MODEL`), plus
**invite-only login** (features.md: "no random people on the page, just the
ones I invite"):

- OIDC login is **auto-accepted** by default for the configured OIDC
  provider app (`InviteGatedSocialAccountAdapter` checks
  `sociallogin.account.provider == settings.OIDC_PROVIDER_ID`, gated by
  `OIDC_AUTO_SIGNUP`, default `True`) — an admin only ever wires up an OIDC
  server they already trust to authenticate the right people, so a
  successful login there already proves the person was let in on that
  server's side. Set `OIDC_AUTO_SIGNUP=false` to require an invite for OIDC
  logins too (e.g. the IdP isn't a closed set of pre-approved people).
- Local email/password signup (django-allauth's `account` app) is
  invite-gated rather than disabled: `NoSelfSignupAccountAdapter
  .is_open_for_signup` only allows it when a valid (unredeemed, unexpired)
  invite token sits in the session, and `clean_email` further enforces the
  invite's optional email lock once the signup form is actually submitted
  (the email isn't known any earlier).
- Invite flow: `/invite/<token>/` (`accounts/views.py`'s `invite_redeem`)
  validates the token, stashes it in the session, and redirects to
  allauth's own `account_signup` form — completing that form creates the
  account and marks the invite redeemed in
  `NoSelfSignupAccountAdapter.save_user`. This is the path for anyone
  without an account on the configured OIDC server (or when OIDC isn't
  configured at all). See `accounts/adapters.py`.
- `backend/templates/allauth/` overrides allauth's bare default templates
  (login, signup, etc.) with styling that matches the SPA — Django's
  `TEMPLATES[0].DIRS` is searched before `APP_DIRS`, so these win.
- Invites are created/managed from Django admin (`accounts/admin.py`) **or**
  from the in-app admin page at `/manage` (SPA route, `IsAdminUser`-gated —
  see "Frontend" below) — `accounts/api.py`'s `GET/POST /api/invites/` and
  `DELETE /api/invites/<id>/` back that page; both paths write the same
  `Invite` rows, there's no separate model or table for the SPA path.
- `GET /api/me/` gained `is_staff` on its response so the frontend can decide
  whether to show the Admin nav link / allow the `/manage` route — this is
  UX only, the real enforcement is `IsAdminUser` server-side (same bar
  Django's own `/admin/` uses via `is_staff`).

**`generation`** — the domain:

- `RenderPreset` — admin-editable **"quality tier"**: `(mode, label,
  megapixels, steps, is_draft, sort_order)`, backing features.md item 4. No
  width/height/duration here at all anymore (see below).
  - **Video modes (t2v/i2v/r2v)**: six tiers per mode as originally seeded
    by `generation/migrations/0012_standard_tier_and_full_duration_range.py`:
    `Draft` (0.2MP, 8 steps, `is_draft=True` — the fast/low-step preview
    tier, not a separate model/pipeline) plus five genuine, non-draft tiers
    — `Standard` (0.2MP, 20 steps — same resolution as Draft but real step
    count, for the cheapest *real* quality rather than a preview), `Low`
    (0.3MP), `Medium` (0.4MP), `High` (0.5MP), `Max` (0.6MP), all 20 steps —
    labels are just a starting point, not fixed: the admin catalog tool
    below can rename/reorder/duplicate them freely (e.g. the live catalog
    has already had "Standard" renamed to "Lowest" through it).
  - **Image modes (t2i/r2i)** and **audio modes (t2a/r2a)** got their own,
    separate, smaller catalogs via
    `generation/migrations/0018_seed_image_audio_catalog.py` — deliberately
    different labels (`Standard`/`Sharp`/`Ultra` for images, `Fast`/`Rich`
    for audio) so the admin catalog doesn't lump them in with the video
    tiers above, which don't apply to a single-frame or audio-only render.
  - `sort_order` (added by `0013_renderpreset_sort_order.py`) is the
    admin-controlled display order, kept in sync across every mode's row
    for the same label — see the reorder endpoint below.
- `RenderDuration` — one selectable clip length for a given `RenderPreset`
  (FK), each with its **own independently admin-set/benchmarked**
  `estimated_render_seconds` rather than one derived from a formula (render
  time doesn't scale perfectly linearly with duration in practice) —
  *every* tier offers every integer second 2–20 (19 options each, direct
  user request), seeded/backfilled by
  `0012_standard_tier_and_full_duration_range.py` (its own docstring has
  the estimate formula used, loosely sanity-checked against two real,
  if noisy, data points — see that migration and "Verification" below).
  Together, `RenderPreset.megapixels` and `RenderDuration.duration_seconds`
  are the two axes that actually determine render time — a UI redesign
  earlier in this project replaced a small flat list of fixed
  `(width, height, duration)` combos (too few options, too much screen
  space) with independent megapixels/duration/aspect-ratio pickers
  (compact: two dropdowns + a slider — see "Frontend" below).
- `generation/admin_api.py` — staff-only (`IsAdminUser`) batch tooling for
  the catalog above, backing the in-app admin's "Quality & Duration" tab
  (see "Frontend" below). No new models: a "quality level" is just a
  convention (every `RenderPreset` row sharing one `label` across modes),
  and "removing" anything is always `is_active=False` (both models'
  `PROTECT` FK from `GenerationJob` makes a hard delete of an in-use row
  fail anyway, so soft-disable is the only option that always works).
  Six endpoints:
  - `GET /api/quality-catalog/` — full read model, grouped by label,
    including inactive rows so they can be re-enabled.
  - `POST /api/quality-levels/` — create a level across one or more modes
    at once, optionally cloning another level's active durations so it
    isn't born unusable.
  - `PATCH /api/quality-levels/<label>/` — rename (updates every mode's
    row at once) and/or partially update/add a mode/set `sort_order`
    directly.
  - `POST /api/quality-levels/reorder/` — bulk reorder; body is every
    existing label in the desired order, 400 if the set doesn't match
    exactly. Also what reorders the quality dropdown on the Generate
    screen, since it shares `RenderPreset.Meta.ordering`.
  - `PATCH /api/quality-durations/<seconds>/` — the actual "limit this
    duration to certain quality levels or modes" tool: a list of
    `(label, mode, is_active, estimated_render_seconds)` targets, all
    validated before anything is written. Also how a brand new duration
    value gets introduced, since it upserts rather than requiring a
    separate create step.
  - `POST /api/quality-durations/estimate/` — fits real completed-job
    render times, **pooled across every quality level of one mode at
    once** rather than one preset at a time (`{mode, apply}`, no `label`).
    The shared dimension is **workload = `job.steps * job.megapixels *
    job.duration_seconds`** (a proxy for total compute/data): a completed
    job on one level and a completed job on another level at the *same*
    requested duration land at *different* workload values, which is what
    lets the fit see the gap between levels and use every level's history
    at once instead of starving each preset of its own sparse data —
    direct user request, expecting the resulting curves to "mirror each
    other" once plotted this way. Needs 2+ distinct workload values among
    completed jobs or returns `fit_available: false` rather than an
    error. Also attempts a **single-breakpoint piecewise fit** —
    brute-force search over candidate workload splits, two independent
    OLS lines, only used if it beats the single line's SSE by ≥15% and
    there are ≥8 total points (guards against overfitting sparse data) —
    modeling the "VRAM → system RAM → swap" resource-cliff hypothesis the
    user described: a real regime change should land at roughly the same
    *workload* across levels even though that's a different
    `duration_seconds` per level. With `apply: true`, writes the selected
    model's fitted estimate onto every `RenderDuration` row that already
    exists for *any* level of that mode, never creating new rows or
    touching `is_active`.

  `GenerationJob` gained a `steps` snapshot field
  (`0014_generationjob_steps_snapshot.py`, mirroring the existing
  `megapixels`/`duration_seconds` snapshots and for the same reason —
  computing workload from `job.preset.steps` live would silently
  mis-attribute old completed jobs to whatever steps count the preset
  has *now* if it's since been edited through this same admin tool).
  **A real bug hit building the single-preset version of this**:
  `RenderDuration.objects.values_list("duration_seconds", flat=True)
  .distinct()` silently returned 342 rows instead of 19 — `RenderPreset
  .Meta.ordering` bleeds into the JOIN's implicit `ORDER BY`, which
  Postgres then requires in the `SELECT` list for `DISTINCT` to be valid,
  turning it into "distinct `(duration_seconds, sort_order, mode,
  megapixels)`" instead. Fixed (in both `_serialize_catalog()` and the
  estimate endpoint) by deduplicating in Python over already-fetched
  values rather than trusting DB-level `DISTINCT` on an ordered queryset —
  worth remembering for any future `.distinct()` on a model with a
  non-trivial `Meta.ordering`.
- `resolution.py` — aspect ratio is a **third, orthogonal axis** that,
  unlike megapixels/duration, does **not** meaningfully affect render time
  for a fixed pixel count — so instead of a third DB-backed catalog
  dimension, it's a small fixed enum (`ASPECT_RATIOS`, mirroring
  `ResolutionSelector`'s own combo options in the ComfyUI workflow itself)
  plus `compute_resolution(megapixels, aspect_ratio) -> (width, height)`, a
  reimplementation of that node's own megapixels+ratio math (rounded to a
  multiple of 32, matching `MiniMaxH3ImageToVideo`/`ReferenceToVideo`'s
  width/height step constraint) since `tasks.py` bypasses that node and
  needs literal pixel dimensions itself — see "Getting the workflows
  working" below.
- `GenerationJob` — one user's request: mode, raw/improved prompt, chosen
  `preset` + `duration` (both FKs — `duration.preset` would derive the same
  preset, but `GenerationJob.preset` is kept directly too for query
  convenience), plus **snapshotted** `megapixels`, `aspect_ratio`, `width`,
  `height` (computed via `resolution.compute_resolution()` at creation
  time), and `duration_seconds` — all copied onto the job itself (not just
  reachable by joining through `preset`/`duration`) so later admin edits to
  the catalog can't retroactively change a number already shown to a user,
  and so `tasks.py` has everything it needs without extra joins. `status` is
  `queued`/`processing`/`done`/`cancelled` — jobs render strictly one at a
  time, FIFO (see `tasks.py` below), and `done` covers both success and
  failure (told apart by `video_file`/`error_message`, not a separate
  terminal status — a real `failed` split can come back if that distinction
  needs to be first-class again). `cancelled` *is* its own terminal status
  (unlike a real failure) purely so the frontend can show "Cancelled"
  distinctly — see `POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel/` below and `cancel_requested`
  just below. The finer-grained "what's actually happening right now" detail
  this deliberately leaves out of `status` lives in the separate `phase`/
  `progress_current`/`progress_total` fields instead (see `api.py` below),
  not by adding more `status` values.
  `cancel_requested` is a separate boolean, not folded into `status`,
  because cancelling a `processing` job is inherently cross-process: the
  cancel request lands in the `backend` container, but the job's row is
  actively owned by `_execute_job()` running in `qcluster` — if the cancel
  request wrote `status=cancelled` directly, `_execute_job()`'s own
  eventual `job.save()` would silently stomp it back to `done` once
  ComfyUI's round trip ends. Setting the flag instead and having
  `_execute_job()` itself poll it (via `comfyui.wait_for_result()`'s/
  `stream_execution_progress()`'s `cancel_check` callbacks) means there's
  still only one writer of the terminal `status`. A still-`queued` job skips
  all of this — `cancel_job()` flips it straight to `cancelled` under the
  same `select_for_update()` locking `_claim_next_job()` uses, since it
  never reached ComfyUI in the first place.
- `ReferenceAsset` — image/video/audio attachments on a job, with a computed
  `label` (`"Picture 1"`, `"Video 1"`, `"Audio 1"`) matching the
  `<Picture N>`/`<Video N>`/`<Audio N>` convention in
  `resources/prompt instructions/VIDEO_PROMPT_WRITING_GUIDE_ref_en.md`, so
  the frontend can offer "insert reference" buttons producing tokens the LLM
  prompt-assist step already understands. Image and (now) audio kinds are
  actually wired into a render (see `tasks.py`/`api.py` below); video kind
  exists on the model but nothing creates one yet — no video-reference
  upload path in the API or frontend.
- `PromptChatSession`/`PromptChatMessage` — an audit trail of a chat
  conversation that actually got used to draft a queued job's prompt, NOT
  the live conversation itself (features.md: "a way to interactively chat
  with the llm"). The live conversation stays entirely client-side (React
  state) — `generation/api.py`'s `chat_message()` is fully stateless, no DB
  writes at all — and only gets persisted here, already linked via
  `resulting_job`, inside the same `POST /api/jobs/` transaction that
  creates the job, if the frontend attaches a `chat_transcript` (direct
  user request: no DB trail for chat content that never ends up backing a
  real job). A conversation the user has but never queues a job with is
  never written here at all. See "LLM integration" below.
- `BenchmarkResult` — one `(mode, width, height, duration_seconds, steps) →
  status/render_seconds` data point from `manage.py benchmark_render_times`
  (see "Benchmarking render times" below). Deliberately separate from
  `RenderPreset`: this holds the full raw sweep (including combinations that
  failed), not the small curated set actually offered to users.
- `queue.py` — `estimated_seconds_ahead()`: sum of `estimated_seconds` over
  every job still queued/processing, **system-wide** — features.md item 5
  wants a combined ETA without exposing other users' individual jobs, so
  this is the only cross-user read the API is meant to expose.
  `expected_finish_times()` goes a step further: a per-job expected finish
  timestamp, computed by walking every active job system-wide in the same
  FIFO order `tasks.py` processes them in (a `processing` job's expected
  finish is its own `started_at` + `estimated_seconds`; every job behind it
  chains off the previous job's expected finish + its own
  `estimated_seconds`). Still only a derived number attached to *your own*
  job in API responses (see `api.py` below) — never another user's job
  identity or details, same "system-wide computation, per-user-scoped
  exposure" pattern as the aggregate.
- `tasks.py` — `process_queue()`, the Django-Q2 entry point: works through
  the entire FIFO queue itself, one job at a time, rather than being a
  per-job task. `_claim_next_job()` atomically claims the oldest still-
  `queued` job system-wide (`order_by("created_at", "id")` + a DB row lock)
  and marks it `processing`; `_execute_job()` then does the actual ComfyUI
  round trip — build the mode's API-format workflow via
  `build_api_workflow()` (prompt, resolution, steps, duration, seed,
  reference images, and — r2v only — reference audio) →
  upload/submit/poll/download → save `video_file` →
  mark `done`, success or failure alike (failure sets `error_message`
  instead of `video_file`, and — deliberately, unlike the old per-job task —
  doesn't re-raise, so the loop keeps working through whatever's left in the
  queue). **FIFO order and one-job-at-a-time-ness are enforced entirely by
  this explicit claim query, not by Django-Q2**: its ORM broker's dequeue
  has no `ORDER BY` (confirmed by reading `django_q/brokers/orm.py`), so
  task pickup order isn't otherwise guaranteed, and `Q_CLUSTER_WORKERS` is
  pinned to `1` (`config/settings.py`) so two different jobs can never run
  in parallel regardless of claim order — the row lock alone only stops the
  *same* job being claimed twice, not that. No LLM call happens in
  `_execute_job()` — prompt refinement is an explicit pre-job user action
  (see below), and `job.improved_prompt` already holds its result (or is
  blank) by the time a job reaches it. `build_api_workflow()` is a pure
  function (given already-uploaded ComfyUI filenames, no DB/network I/O) so
  it's shared between this and the benchmark command without needing fake
  DB rows. Fully wired for all three modes and dry-run validated against the
  live containerized DB (mocked ComfyUI upload calls, no real network/GPU
  cost) — see "Getting the workflows working" below; the FIFO claim/
  serialization logic itself was verified for real (see "Verification"
  below).
- `api.py`/`urls.py` — `GET /api/health/`, `GET /api/config/` (feature
  flags: `llm_enabled`; `oidc_enabled`/`oidc_login_url`/`oidc_provider_name`
  so the SPA's login screen knows whether to render an OIDC button and
  where it points; `aspect_ratios` + `default_aspect_ratio`, mirroring
  `resolution.ASPECT_RATIOS` — doesn't vary per mode, so it lives here
  rather than being repeated on every preset), `POST /api/prompt/refine/`
  (one-shot "AI refine"), `POST /api/prompt/chat/` (the whole conversation
  is passed in and echoed back each call — stateless, no session model or
  DB row; see "LLM integration" below for why), `GET /api/presets/` (optionally
  `?mode=`, each preset's response nests its nested `durations` array so
  the frontend has every selectable clip length up front without an extra
  round trip when the user changes the megapixels dropdown),
  `GET /api/queue-estimate/?duration_id=` (features.md item 5's combined
  ETA, via `queue.estimated_seconds_ahead()` — keyed by `duration_id` since
  that alone determines the estimate; aspect ratio doesn't affect it, so
  it's not a query param here), and `GET|POST /api/jobs/` +
  `GET /api/jobs/{id}/`. `POST /api/jobs/` takes `duration_id` (which alone
  implies both the preset and the clip length) + `aspect_ratio` (separately
  — doesn't affect estimation), computes `width`/`height` via
  `resolution.compute_resolution()`, and creates the `GenerationJob` (with
  all those values snapshotted, see "generation" above) and any attached
  `ReferenceAsset` rows in one atomic multipart request (`reference_images`
  — repeatable file field, order matters: i2v's first/second become
  first/last frame, r2v's up to 9 become `<Picture N>` tokens; `reference_audio`
  and `reference_video` — r2v only, up to 3 each, becoming `<Audio N>`/
  `<Video N>` tokens), then
  enqueues `generation.tasks.process_queue` via Django-Q2 (no job id — it's
  a shared queue processor, see `tasks.py` above; safe to enqueue
  redundantly on every job creation) — there's no separate staging step,
  since reference files are already staged client-side before submission
  (the same pattern `reference_labels` on `/api/prompt/refine/` assumes).
  Every job response (list, detail, and the
  create response itself) includes `raw_prompt` (lifted to the base
  serializer, not detail-only, so the frontend's queue sidebar can show a
  title without a second request per job), `prompt_hash` (FNV-1a 32-bit,
  8 hex chars, of the prompt actually sent to ComfyUI — `improved_prompt
  or raw_prompt`, the same resolution `tasks.py` uses — so the queue list
  can derive a stable per-prompt color line without shipping full prompt
  text per item; see `api.py::_prompt_hash()` and
  `frontend/src/features/queue/promptColor.ts`), and
  `expected_finish_time` (via
  `queue.expected_finish_times()`, `null` once `done`), plus `phase` and
  `progress_current`/`progress_total` (`0016_generationjob_phase_progress.py`)
  — populated live by `integrations/comfyui.py`'s
  `stream_execution_progress()` watching ComfyUI's own execution WebSocket
  events, and rendered as the queue sidebar's per-job progress bar
  (`frontend/src/features/queue/JobProgressBar.tsx`); a finer-grained
  sub-state than the coarse `status` field below ever tries to be.
  `GET /api/jobs/{id}/` is what the frontend polls for status; the same
  URL also takes `DELETE`
  (409 while `processing` — `_execute_job()` is actively mutating that row —
  otherwise removes the job's reference/video files from disk and the row
  itself, `204` on success). `GET /api/jobs/{id}/steam_deck_export/`
   streams the job's video re-encoded as a Steam Deck start video (see
   `media_post.py` above) as `video/webm` attachment bytes. `POST
   /api/jobs/{id}/cancel/` handles the
  `processing` case `DELETE` refuses: a `queued` job is cancelled directly
  (409 if it's already terminal); a `processing` job instead sets
  `cancel_requested` and best-effort tells ComfyUI to stop
  (`comfyui.cancel_prompt()` — dequeue *and* interrupt, since which one
  applies depends on whether ComfyUI has actually started executing it
  yet), then returns immediately with the job still showing `processing`;
  it's `_execute_job()`'s own wait loop, over in `qcluster`, that actually
  writes `cancelled` once ComfyUI's round trip ends — see `GenerationJob`
  above for why. Every view carries an `@extend_schema`
  (drf-spectacular, per-method via `methods=[...]` on `job_detail` since one
  `@api_view` handles both `GET` and `DELETE`) describing its request/response
  shape for the auto-generated API docs — see "API documentation" below.
  `accounts/api.py` additionally exposes `GET /api/me/` (`AllowAny`,
  returns `{authenticated: false}` rather than 403 when logged out) so the
  SPA can decide at boot whether to show the app or send the user to login.

**`integrations`** (plain packages, no models/migrations):

- `comfyui.py` — real implementation of upload / queue / poll / download /
  extract-output / delete-output / clear-history / error-status-detection /
  reachability-check / cancel, following `resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md`
  §5–§10. Doesn't know about any specific workflow's node ids — callers own
  the API-format JSON. `check_for_error()` and `is_alive()` exist specifically
  so a prompt that ComfyUI accepted but then failed server-side (e.g. an
  OOM it caught itself) surfaces as a clear error instead of a confusing
  `KeyError` reaching into an unpopulated `outputs` dict, and so the
  benchmark command can tell a slow-but-alive server apart from a crashed one.
  `cancel_prompt()` (backing `POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel/`, see "Backend
  apps" above) POSTs both `/queue` (`{"delete": [prompt_id]}`, dequeues it if
  it hasn't started executing) and `/interrupt` (stops whatever's currently
  executing, taking no `prompt_id` itself — safe to call unconditionally
  since `Q_CLUSTER_WORKERS=1` guarantees at most one prompt is ever in
  flight). `wait_for_result()`/`stream_execution_progress()` both take an
  optional `cancel_check` callback, polled once per loop iteration, so a
  cancellation is noticed promptly rather than only once ComfyUI's own
  `/history` (which may never come, if the prompt was dequeued before it
  ever ran) or full multi-minute timeout resolves it.
- `llm.py` — OpenAI-compatible chat-completion client; loads the right guide
  from `resources/prompt instructions/` per mode as system context: the base
  guide for t2v/i2v, the reference guide for r2v, and simpler
  purpose-written guides for the four image/audio modes (t2i/r2i/t2a/r2a)
  rather than reusing the video guides verbatim — most of what a video
  prompt guide covers (motion, pacing, duration) doesn't apply once the
  output is a single frame or an audio track. `is_configured()` backs
  `settings.LLM_ENABLED`. Three entry points: `improve_prompt()` (one-shot
  rewrite), `chat_reply()` (multi-turn, given the full prior history), and
  `plan_scenes()` (one-shot script/idea → proposed scene list, backing
  Director Mode's "Generate from script" — see below). Both
  `improve_prompt()`/`chat_reply()` take an optional `extra_context`
  string, appended to the system prompt via `_extra_context_note()` —
  Director Mode's only hook into this module beyond `plan_scenes()` itself,
  used to pass a project's `overarching_prompt` through so a clip's
  refine/chat stays consistent with the rest of the project.
- `media_post.py` — ffmpeg-based post-processing backing the experimental
  image/audio modes: pulls a still frame or the audio track out of the
  video `tasks.py` actually rendered, since those modes submit the same
  t2v/r2v graph rather than having workflows of their own (see the
  top-level README's "Updating the ComfyUI workflows" section). Also
  `to_steam_deck_webm()`: transcodes an already-rendered video to exactly
  1280x800 VP9+Opus WebM (scaled + letterboxed, never cropped) — the
  format Steam Deck's custom startup-movie replacement needs — backing
  `api.py::steam_deck_export()` (`GET /api/jobs/{id}/steam_deck_export/`,
  JobModal's "Steam Deck video" button). VP9 is CPU-encoded (`libvpx-vp9`)
  because this container has no hardware encoder, so it's deliberately
  run on request with its own longer timeout
  (`STEAM_DECK_EXPORT_TIMEOUT`) rather than pre-made at render time.
- `hooks.py` — optional site-specific hook mechanism: `PRE_LLM_HOOK`/
  `POST_LLM_HOOK`/`PRE_RENDER_HOOK`/`POST_RENDER_HOOK` settings, each a
  Python dotted path to a callable, wired into `llm.py`/`tasks.py` around
  the LLM call and the render itself. All optional/unset by default; see
  `backend/hooks_example.py` for the expected signature of each.

## Director Mode

A separate `director` app, layered strictly on top of `generation`
(imports `generation`'s models/queue; `generation` never imports
`director` back — the one seam that runs the other way is a Django
signal, `generation.signals.job_finished`, connected from
`director/apps.py`'s `ready()`). A "movie" is a `Project`: a title, an
`overarching_prompt` (shared world/setting/character prose every clip
draws on), an `aspect_ratio`/`quality_label` (see "Project-wide aspect
ratio & quality" below), a set of `ProjectResource`s (character
sheets/voice/world refs), and an ordered sequence of `Clip`s — each one a
single `GenerationJob`-backed render, positioned by `order`.

- **Continuity** — a `Clip` can be flagged `continues_previous`
  (positional: "splice motion/audio continuity from whichever clip is now
  immediately before me", not a stored predecessor FK — reordering the
  board changes what a continuation clip actually continues from, and
  always marks it dirty). Real continuity goes through
  `integrations/motion_context.py`'s splice into
  ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Contex-Loop's Chain pipeline (`MiniMaxH3ChainPlan` →
  `MiniMaxH3ChainLoopStart` → `MiniMaxH3ChainCurrent` →
  `MiniMaxH3ChainContext` → `MiniMaxH3ChainSegmentSave`, `scene_range`
  pinned to one scene per submission so this app's one-job-per-clip queue
  model doesn't need the extension's own recursion/review-gate machinery).
  `is_available()` live-checks (60s cached) whether the extension is
  installed; when it isn't — or a continuation clip's immediate
  predecessor has no real chain checkpoint of its own — `director/
  services.py::_build_job_for_clip()` falls back to feeding the
  predecessor's last extracted frame in as an ordinary image reference
  (`integrations/media_post.py::extract_last_frame()`). See
  `extras.md#contex-loop` for the extension's install/verification
  details and the fallback's known tradeoffs (motion/audio can stutter at
  the join without the real extension).
- **Dirty-cascade** — editing a clip's render-affecting fields (prompt,
  refs, duration, `continues_previous`) marks it dirty, then walks forward
  marking every directly-chained `continues_previous` clip after it dirty
  too, stopping at the next clip that starts a fresh scene. Editing
  `Project.overarching_prompt`/`aspect_ratio`/`quality_label`/resources
  dirties every clip in the project (`director/services.py`'s
  `mark_dirty_cascade()`/`mark_project_dirty()`).
- **Project-wide aspect ratio & quality** — both live on `Project`, not
  `Clip`: MiniMax H3's continuity model requires every scene in a chain to
  share one resolution, and a shared quality tier keeps every clip's
  render comparable, so neither is a per-clip choice. `quality_label` is a
  `RenderPreset.label` string (quality tiers share a label across modes
  but each mode has its own row/megapixels, see `RenderPreset`'s own
  docstring) — `director/services.py::resolve_preset_for_mode()` looks up
  the right row for a given `Clip.mode`, falling back to that mode's first
  active preset if the label has no row for it. A `Clip`'s own
  `preset`/`width`/`height` are just cached derivations, recomputed
  whenever the project setting changes
  (`recompute_project_resolutions()`, called from `project_detail()`'s
  PATCH) or a single clip's `continues_previous` toggles
  (`resolve_clip_width_height()`, from `clip_detail()`'s PATCH) — a
  continuing clip's width/height are always locked to its immediate
  predecessor's own values regardless of what its own resolved preset's
  megapixels would otherwise imply, so a chain never mismatches even
  across a mode change (e.g. a t2v clip continued by an i2v one).
  **Duration is locked the same way** (`resolve_clip_duration()`, same
  call sites) — this one isn't just a resolution nicety:
  `MiniMaxH3ChainLoopStart` validates every resubmission in a run against
  whatever scene 1 was originally submitted with, including
  `default_duration_seconds`/`default_steps`, and rejects the resume
  outright on a mismatch ("clip N was generated from different settings,
  prompts, seeds, or durations" — confirmed against a real failed
  render). `_resolve_chain_params()` also reads those two values from the
  run's head clip (`chain_clips[0]`) defensively, regardless of what the
  currently-rendering clip's own fields say.
- **Shared resources require reference mode** — a `ProjectResource` can
  only actually reach a render through `MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo`'s
  `ref_image_N`/etc inputs, so once a project has any, every `Clip` in it
  must be `r2v` (`director/services.py::project_requires_reference_mode()`,
  enforced by `clips()`/`project_resources()` POST). At render time,
  `_build_job_for_clip()` feeds `_combined_references()`'s list into the
  new `GenerationJob`: the project's resources first (so a `<Picture N>`
  token means the same thing in every clip's prompt), then the clip's own
  `ClipReferenceAsset`s appended after, per kind —
  `ClipReferenceAsset.label`'s displayed token is offset by the project's
  own resource count of that kind so what the UI shows always matches
  what actually gets wired in. Both `clips()`/`clip_references()`/
  `project_resources()` POST validate the *combined* count (shared +
  a clip's own) against the mode's real cap (9 images/3 audio/3 video for
  r2v), not just each side independently — a shared resource add is
  rejected if it would push any existing clip over the limit.
  `director/services.py::renumber_clip_reference_tokens()` keeps every
  clip's written prompt text in sync whenever a shared resource is added
  or removed: since a written prompt only has the literal `<Picture N>`
  number to say "which reference this is" (no structured link back to a
  specific row), adding/removing a resource shifts where every clip's own
  references start numbering from, so this rewrites those token mentions
  in place. It can't recover a mention of the one resource actually being
  deleted (nothing left to remap it to) — everything else stays correct.
- **Render orchestration** — `render_clip()` walks backward to find the
  head of a dirty continuation run and enqueues only that job;
  `director/signals.py`'s `on_job_finished` receiver (listening to
  `generation.signals.job_finished`) advances the chain by creating the
  next clip's job once its predecessor succeeds, and is the only place
  `Clip.chain_run_name`/`chain_scene_number` get set (only on confirmed
  success — never eagerly at job-creation time, so a failed render can't
  leave a later clip "resuming" from a checkpoint that was never actually
  saved). `POST /api/director/projects/<id>/cancel_all/` cancels every
  clip currently queued/processing at once (`api.py`'s `_cancel_clip_job()`
  helper, shared with the single-clip `cancel_clip()` endpoint) — stops
  "Render all dirty" (or any number of independently-advancing chains)
  mid-flight in one action.
- **AI continuity awareness** — two things address a real failure mode
  (confirmed live: an unstructured continuation prompt jumped to a
  different camera angle, and a prompt that only implied dialogue got
  invented lines from the render model). First, `integrations/llm.py`'s
  shared `_PROMPT_STYLE_NOTE` now always tells the LLM to write exact
  dialogue words rather than describing that a character "says
  something", and `improve_prompt()`/`chat_reply()` take an
  `is_continuation` flag (`_continuation_note()`) that tells it a
  `continues_previous` clip's prompt must read as an unbroken continuation
  of the previous clip's angle/setting/characters, not a fresh shot — both
  also apply to `plan_scenes()`'s system prompt and
  `DIRECTOR_PLAN_GUIDE_en.md` itself. Second, `ClipEditorPanel` passes a
  short summary of every earlier clip's raw prompt (mode + truncated text,
  built by `ProjectBoard`'s `buildPreviousClipsContext()`) as additional
  `extra_context`, so refine/chat isn't limited to the project's
  `overarching_prompt` alone. Third, `POST /api/director/projects/<id>/
  check_continuity/` (`integrations/llm.check_project_continuity()`) sends
  every clip's prompt at once and returns a free-text (not
  structured/automated) report of problems it finds, shown in a modal —
  purely informational, changes nothing.
- **LLM planning ("Generate from script")** — `POST
  /api/director/projects/<id>/plan/` calls `integrations/llm.plan_scenes()`
  (system context: `resources/prompt instructions/
  DIRECTOR_PLAN_GUIDE_en.md`, concatenated with the base video prompt
  guide) and returns a *preview* list of proposed scenes
  (`{mode, continues_previous, prompt, notes}`) — nothing is created yet.
  `director/services.py::normalize_planned_scenes()` coerces/repairs the
  LLM's untrusted JSON reply (unknown mode → `t2v`, `continues_previous`
  forced `False` when the mode can't support it) rather than failing the
  whole plan over one bad entry. The user reviews/edits the preview
  client-side, then `POST /api/director/projects/<id>/plan/apply/` (body:
  the — possibly edited — scene list, `replace: bool`) calls
  `apply_planned_scenes()` to actually create `Clip` rows, appended after
  the project's existing clips by default or replacing them entirely.
  Applying never itself triggers a render. When the project has shared
  resources (see above), both `plan_scenes()` and `normalize_
  planned_scenes()` take a `require_reference_mode` flag: the former
  swaps in the reference variant of the house guide and tells the model
  every scene must be r2v and should use the listed reference tokens
  (`<Picture N>` etc., each with its human label parenthesized as
  context, e.g. `Picture 1 (Alice — character sheet)`) where relevant;
  the latter then force-sets every scene's mode to r2v regardless of what
  the LLM actually wrote, since that field isn't trusted either way.
- **Assembly/export** — `POST /api/director/projects/<id>/assemble/`
  requires every clip to be rendered and clean, then concatenates their
  videos in board order via `integrations/assembly.py::concat_videos()`
  into `Project.assembled_video_file`. Deliberately **not** the
  stream-copy concat demuxer (`-c copy`): even though aspect ratio/quality
  are project-wide now, a clip rendered before the most recent settings
  change (and not yet re-rendered) can still be at a different resolution
  than its neighbours, which stream-copy concat doesn't tolerate reliably
  — so this always goes through the concat *filter* instead, scaling/
  padding every clip onto the largest clip's resolution and normalizing to
  the first clip's frame rate before concatenation. Runs synchronously in
  the request (clips are short, so total runtime is small); overwrites any
  previous export.
- **Media serving** — `ProjectResource`/`ClipReferenceAsset`/
  `Project.assembled_video_file` live under their own `director_*/`
  `MEDIA_ROOT` prefixes, served by `director/media_views.py`'s own
  ownership check (mirrors `generation/media_views.py`'s, duplicated
  rather than shared so `generation` stays ignorant of `director`) —
  wired into `config/urls.py` ahead of `generation`'s catch-all. Adding a
  new `FileField` here needs a matching prefix added in **three** places:
  the `re_path` in `config/urls.py`, `_owner_id_for_path()` in
  `director/media_views.py`, and (if it should count toward a project's
  storage) nowhere else today — see the `generation/media_views.py`
  gotcha in `AGENTS.md` for what happens when this is forgotten.
- **Frontend** — `frontend/src/features/director/`: `ProjectListScreen`
  (per-project rename/delete inline on each card, plus a `clip_count`/
  `dirty_count`/`active_count`/`eta_seconds` progress summary from the
  list endpoint's annotated queryset — see `projects()`'s GET — polling
  while any project has an active render, same shape as the board's own
  polling)
  → `ProjectBoard` (title, overarching prompt, the project-wide aspect
  ratio/quality selectors, `ProjectResourcesPanel` — which hides its
  "add" controls and explains why whenever the project has a non-r2v clip
  — the clip timeline with chain connectors between continuation boxes
  and a "+ Reference clip"-only add-row once the project has resources,
  "Generate from script…"/"Check continuity"/"Render all dirty"/
  "Cancel all"/"Export" actions) →
  `ClipEditorPanel` (prompt + AI refine/chat — reuses the same
  `ChatModal`/`useRefinePrompt`/`useChatReply` as the main Generate
  screen, with the project's `overarching_prompt` threaded through as
  `extra_context` and its resources' `token_label`s prepended to the
  reference-labels list passed alongside — only a duration slider remains
  here; quality/aspect ratio moved to the board, see above — and a Turbo
  status line in the toolbar showing the clip's *effective* turbo state,
  since Director has no per-clip turbo: the project's own `use_turbo`
  flag resolved against `turbo_level` exactly like `_resolve_use_turbo()`
  does at render time (hidden when `turbo_level` is null, i.e. turbo not
  offered in this deployment) — reference
  slots, render/cancel/delete). `ScriptPlanModal` is the two-step
  "propose, then confirm" UI for the LLM planning endpoints above —
  lists the project's shared references (token + label) up front when
  any exist, so the user knows what's available to mention in their
  idea text even though the LLM already gets the same list automatically.
  Routes: `/director` and `/director/:projectId` in `App.tsx`.

## Frontend

React (Vite + TS), talking to the API via `src/api/client.ts`'s
session-cookie fetch wrapper (see "Why a single nginx entrypoint" above).
`src/api/queries.ts` wraps every backend endpoint in a TanStack Query hook —
one place owning query keys, polling intervals, and cache invalidation, so
the `features/*` components stay UI-only. `src/api/types.ts` holds the TS
shapes matching each endpoint's JSON, kept by hand in sync with
`generation/api.py`/`accounts/api.py` (no codegen from the OpenAPI schema
yet — see "Deferred" below).

**Auth gating (`App.tsx`)** — at boot, calls `GET /api/me/`; while logged
out, renders `features/auth/LoginScreen` instead of any route. Login itself
is entirely Django/allauth's job: an OIDC button (shown only when
`GET /api/config/`'s `oidc_enabled` is true, pointing at `oidc_login_url`)
and a plain link to `/accounts/login/` for admin-created accounts. There's
no client-side login form — the SPA only ever redirects the browser at
Django-served pages and later notices the resulting session cookie.
`LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`/`ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` are set to `"/"` in
`config/settings.py` so both land back on the SPA (Django/allauth's default,
`/accounts/profile/`, doesn't exist in an API+SPA project — hit this as a
real 404 while testing the login flow end to end, see "Verification" below).

Once authenticated, `App.tsx` renders a persistent two-pane `MainLayout`
(replacing an earlier version's two separate routed pages, `/` and `/jobs`,
per direct user feedback wanting the queue visible "on the right" while
generating rather than a page navigation away — `/jobs` now just redirects
to `/`): `GenerateScreen` on the left/center, `QueueSidebar` always visible
on the right. `selectedJobId` (which job's `JobModal` is open, if any) and
`redoPayload` (a job to prefill the Generate form from) live in `MainLayout`
and get passed down — the three components are siblings, not routed pages,
so this is plain prop-drilling rather than URL/router state. There's no
`?job=` deep link for the modal — a deliberate simplification.

**`features/generate/GenerateScreen.tsx`** — above the form, two tab strips:

- A **content-type** row (`Video` / `Image` / `Audio`) — all three are
  enabled; `Image`/`Audio` carry an "Experimental" badge
  (`EXPERIMENTAL_CONTENT_TYPES`) and a warning notice, since they reuse the
  video pipeline at extreme settings (via `media_post.py`, see
  "integrations" above) rather than a purpose-built path.
- A **mode** row beneath it, scoped to the selected content type:
  t2v/i2v/r2v for Video, t2i/r2i for Image, t2a/r2a for Audio. The mode
  drives which reference fields render below: i2v gets two explicit file
  slots ("First frame" / "Last frame (optional)"), each showing a local
  thumbnail preview once a file is picked; r2v/r2i/r2a get a dynamic
  add/remove **image** list (thumbnails + "Insert token" writing
  `<Picture N>`) and — r2v/r2a only, not r2i — a separate dynamic **audio**
  list (`<Audio N>` tokens, filename only, no useful static thumbnail for
  audio; r2i skips it since a still frame extracted from the underlying
  video can't carry any reference-audio influence); t2v/t2i/t2a get
  neither. `MAX_REFERENCE_IMAGES`/`MAX_REFERENCE_AUDIO` on the frontend
  mirror `generation/api.py`'s `_MAX_REFERENCE_IMAGES`/
  `_MAX_REFERENCE_AUDIO` (images: t2v/t2i/t2a 0, i2v 2, r2v/r2i/r2a 9;
  audio: t2v/i2v/t2i/t2a/r2i 0, r2v/r2a 3) so the "add" controls disable at
  the right count instead of relying on the eventual 400 from the server.

Thumbnails are `URL.createObjectURL(file)` previews (revoked on
change/unmount via a small `useObjectUrl`/`useObjectUrls` helper) —
client-side only, nothing uploaded yet at this point.

"Resolution & length" is a compact, unbordered **toolbar** row (not a boxed
fieldset, and not a list of preset cards — two redesigns back from the
original big radio-card-per-combo version, then subdued further per direct
user feedback that it was still taking too much visual weight relative to
the prompt): a **Quality** `<select>` (the `RenderPreset`/megapixels tier,
`GET /api/presets/?mode=`, auto-selecting the first non-draft one), an
**Aspect ratio** `<select>` (from `GET /api/config/`'s `aspect_ratios`,
defaulting to `default_aspect_ratio` — independent of mode, so switching
mode doesn't reset it; i2v adds one extra, client-computed option once a
first frame is picked — `computeImageAspectRatio()` reads the image's own
pixel dimensions and offers "match first frame" as an extra entry, not
sourced from `/api/config/` at all, validated server-side the same as any
other value via `resolution.is_valid_aspect_ratio()`), and a **Length** `<input type="range">` whose stops
are exactly the selected preset's `durations` array (an index into that
array, not a continuous value — so it only ever lands on an
actually-benchmarked duration) with its own per-duration estimate shown
live next to it. Switching the quality tier keeps the same clip length if
the new tier offers it (every tier offers the same 2–20s range as of
`0012_standard_tier_and_full_duration_range.py`, so in practice this always
holds now), otherwise picks the *nearest* available length — a
`lastDurationSecondsRef` tracks the last-selected seconds value
independently of `durationId`, since once the tier changes, `durations` is
already the *new* tier's list, which the *old* id was never a member of;
an earlier version tried to look the old id up in the new array and always
came back empty, silently falling back to the tier's first option instead
of actually preserving the user's choice — a real bug, fixed this pass (a
direct user request: "keep the same seconds selected, or pick nearest").
`GET /api/queue-estimate/` is keyed off `duration_id` alone (aspect
ratio doesn't affect it) and re-fetches whenever the selected duration
changes, showing this render's own time plus the current system backlog
before the user commits.

The **prompt** fieldset is deliberately the most visually prominent element
on the screen (larger textarea, more rows, `autoFocus`, the only
heavy-bordered fieldset besides the reference lists) per the "prompt should
be more in focus" feedback that also drove the toolbar's subdued styling
above. It shows "AI refine"/"Chat with AI" only when `llm_enabled`; refine
(`POST /api/prompt/refine/`) writes into a separate `improvedPrompt` field
shown alongside the raw one (with "edit as raw" / "discard"), rather than
overwriting what the user typed, matching the backend's
`raw_prompt`/`improved_prompt` split (`tasks.py` prefers `improved_prompt`
when present). Chat is entirely client-side state (`chatMessages`) until a
job actually gets queued with it attached — see "LLM integration" below for
the full stateless design. Each assistant reply gets a **"Use as
AI-refined prompt"** button — renamed and rewired this pass from "Use as
prompt" (which overwrote the *raw* prompt box, clobbering what the user had
typed) to instead populate `improvedPrompt`, the same field the one-shot
refine button uses, alongside its own "edit as raw"/"discard" actions —
direct user request, since a chat suggestion is naturally an AI-refined
output, not the user's own words. Submitting posts one multipart
`POST /api/jobs/` (mode, `duration_id`, `aspect_ratio`, both prompt fields,
any staged reference files/audio, and `chat_transcript` if the chat was
used), resets the form, and does nothing else — no modal, no
navigation. The job just shows up in the always-visible `QueueSidebar`
(it reactively refetches via `useCreateJob`'s own cache invalidation, see
`api/queries.ts`), matching direct user feedback that queuing shouldn't
interrupt the flow with a popup — the modal is opt-in, only from clicking
an entry (see `QueueSidebar` below). (An earlier version of this screen
opened the new job's `JobModal` automatically via an `onJobCreated` prop —
removed entirely, not left as a no-op, once nothing needed it anymore.)

A `redoJob` prop (set by `JobModal`'s "Redo" button, see below) prefills
`mode`/`aspectRatio`/`rawPrompt`/`improvedPrompt` directly (the latter was
a real bug for one pass — the effect explicitly cleared it instead of
restoring `redoJob.improved_prompt`, so redoing an AI-refined job silently
lost the refinement) and stashes the target `duration_id` in
`pendingRedoDurationId` until that mode's presets have (re)loaded, then
resolves it to the matching preset+duration pair (the tier whose
`durations` array actually contains that id). Reference files **are**
restored too (a real bug for one pass — first shipped as a documented
limitation, since a `File` object itself can't be recovered client-side
once already uploaded; fixed by re-fetching each reference's bytes from
its own already-uploaded, same-origin `ref.url` and repacking them as a
fresh `File` via `fetchAsFile()`, sorted back into the right slots by
`order`/`kind` the same way `tasks.py` interprets them server-side —
i2v's first two into `firstFrame`/`lastFrame`, r2v's into `refImages`/
`referenceAudio`). This needed a real fix for a subtle async-ordering bug
too: the restore fetch is naturally async, and the effect calls
`onRedoConsumed()` in the same pass, which sets the `redoJob` prop back to
`null` — a naive cleanup-based cancellation guard (`let cancelled = false`
+ return a cleanup setting it `true`) can't tell that transition apart
from the redo genuinely being superseded by a *different* one, and ends up
cancelling every restore before its fetches even resolve. Fixed with an
`activeRedoIdRef` instead — set to the redo job's id when a restore
starts, checked (not cleanup-triggered) after the fetches resolve, so only
an actually-different, newer redo aborts a stale one.

**`features/queue/QueueSidebar.tsx`** — a compact always-visible list of the
user's own jobs (`GET /api/jobs/`, same 4s-while-active polling as before)
with a small system-wide backlog line up top (`GET /api/queue-estimate/`
with no `duration_id`). Each entry: a title (the job's `raw_prompt`,
truncated to ~40 chars — this is why `raw_prompt` moved to the base job
serializer, see "Backend apps" above), a status badge (`didJobFail()` still
distinguishes a `done`-but-no-`video_url` job as "Failed" for display
purposes only — the backend's real `status` values are `queued`/
`processing`/`done`/`cancelled`, see "Backend apps" above), the job's
quality-tier label (`preset_label`, right-aligned on that same row) so the
list shows what quality each job rendered at without opening it — with a
🚀 marker + accent color on that label when `use_turbo` is set, so turbo
jobs stand out in the list without opening them — a relative
timestamp, and — once `done` with a `video_url` — a poster-image thumbnail
(`thumbnail_url`, falling back to a bare `<video preload="metadata">` for
for that job's id.

**`features/queue/JobModal.tsx`** (new) — fetches full detail via the
existing `useJob(jobId)` hook and shows: the prompt (raw, and the
AI-refined one if used), resolution (`width×height`, `aspect_ratio`, and
`megapixels` — direct user request, previously missing from this view
despite being on the job already) and length, render time (actual
`finished_at − started_at` once done, else the
`~estimated_seconds` figure), a **Turbo** line that always says Yes/No
(whether this job rendered with the Turbo LoRA speedup — direct user
request: the detail page must show it even when it's *not* used, unlike
Spectrum, which only gets a line when actually used), the video itself
large with controls, a
**Download** link (`<a href={video_url} download>` — the video URL is
already same-origin thanks to the `/media/` fix above, so this just works),
a **Redo** button (hands the fetched job up to `MainLayout` as
`redoPayload`), a **Cancel job** button (`POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel/`,
shown only while `status` is `queued` or `processing` — see "Backend apps"
above for how a `processing` cancel actually resolves asynchronously
server-side), and a **Delete** button (`DELETE /api/jobs/{id}/`, disabled
with an explanatory `title` while `status === "processing"` — mirroring the
backend's 409 rather than just discovering it from a failed request).
Known gap carried over from before: the list-level `didJobFail()` label is
frontend-only, still derived from `video_url`'s absence rather than the
backend's real `error_message` (which the modal *does* show, now that a
detail-per-job view exists) — see "Deferred" below.

Styling is plain CSS (`App.css`/`index.css`) using the same light/dark
CSS-custom-property tokens Vite's template scaffolded — no component
library. No tests yet (see "Deferred" below).

## API documentation

Auto-generated via `drf-spectacular`, not hand-written — it's built from the
actual views, so it can't drift out of sync with reality the way a
maintained-by-hand reference would as endpoints keep changing.

- `GET /api/schema/` — the raw OpenAPI 3.0 schema.
- `GET /api/schema/swagger-ui/` — interactive Swagger UI (try requests
  directly from the browser).
- `GET /api/schema/redoc/` — Redoc's read-focused rendering of the same schema.

All three are browsable without logging in (the schema isn't sensitive) even
though the endpoints it documents require session auth to actually call.
Every view in `generation/api.py` carries an `@extend_schema` with an inline
`Serializer` describing its request/response shape — these serializers exist
purely for documentation, since the views themselves still do lightweight
manual `request.data` validation rather than using DRF serializers for real
(see that file's module docstring). Verified this pass: `manage.py
spectacular` generates cleanly (no warnings), and `/api/schema/` +
`/api/schema/swagger-ui/` both serve correctly through the full stack
(nginx → backend).

## LLM integration: entirely optional, two features when present

Per features.md: **no LLM configured → no AI UI at all.**
`settings.LLM_ENABLED` (`config/settings.py`) is `True` only when
`LLM_API_BASE_URL`/`LLM_MODEL` are both set; `LLM_API_KEY` is deliberately
**not** part of that gate (`integrations/llm.py`'s `_post_chat_completion()`
only sends an `Authorization` header when it's actually non-empty) — plenty
of self-hosted OpenAI-compatible servers (llama.cpp server, LM Studio,
text-generation-webui, vLLM in permissive mode) don't require a key at all,
and requiring one anyway silently disabled AI features for exactly that
setup (a real bug, hit and fixed this pass — see "Verification" below).
The frontend is meant to check `GET /api/config/`'s `llm_enabled` once at
boot and hide the refine button/chat entirely when it's `False`. Even hit
directly, the refine/chat endpoints fail cleanly with `503` rather than
crashing when unconfigured (verified). There is deliberately no
automatic/implicit LLM call anywhere in the job-execution path —
refinement only happens when a user explicitly asks for it:

- **"AI refine" button** → `POST /api/prompt/refine/` → `llm.improve_prompt()`
  → one-shot rewrite. Wired to `GenerateScreen`'s "AI refine" button (see
  "Frontend" above).
- **Interactive chat** → `POST /api/prompt/chat/` (single, stateless
  endpoint — no session id, `generation/api.py`'s `chat_message()` does
  zero DB reads/writes) → `llm.chat_reply()`, system-prompted to converse
  and help draft a prompt rather than immediately rewriting one. The
  frontend (`chatMessages` React state) resends the whole prior transcript
  as `history` with every turn; nothing is persisted server-side during the
  live conversation at all — a `PromptChatSession`/`PromptChatMessage`
  trail only gets created if/when the user actually queues a job with this
  chat's transcript attached (`chat_transcript` on `POST /api/jobs/`, see
  "Frontend" above and "generation" above) — direct user request: no DB
  trail for chat content that never ends up backing a real job. (An
  earlier version of this feature had `POST /api/prompt/chat/sessions/`
  eagerly create a session on open and persist every message as it was
  sent — replaced entirely, not layered on top of.) Two more pieces of
  context get passed to the model that weren't before, also direct user
  requests:
  - **The user's current draft prompt** (`GenerateScreen`'s `rawPrompt`,
    even if never sent as a chat message) — folded into the system message
    as a note, so the assistant is aware of it from turn one instead of the
    user having to repeat themselves. Verified against the real LLM: asked
    it to "finalize" with no other context beyond a draft prompt already
    typed in the main box, and its reply directly referenced that draft's
    content unprompted.
  - **Reference images** — resent with every chat call (the frontend
    already has them in memory client-side) and attached to the latest
    turn as OpenAI-vision-style `image_url` content parts, but *only* when
    `settings.LLM_VISION_ENABLED` (new env var, default off) — a text-only
    model receiving image content it doesn't understand may error or just
    ignore it, so this needs an explicit opt-in rather than being always-on.
    `GET /api/config/`'s new `llm_vision_enabled` field lets the frontend
    skip the upload entirely when it's off. **Tried against this project's
    own actually-configured model** (not assumed): sent a real solid-red
    test pixel and asked its color — the model replied "I cannot see any
    attached image yet," i.e. vision is *not* actually working end-to-end
    with this specific model/server combo (very likely the inference
    server has no vision-projector loaded alongside the text model — a
    common local-serving gotcha, not necessarily a model limitation) — left
    `LLM_VISION_ENABLED` off in this deployment's real `.env` based on that
    finding, not left to silently waste upload bandwidth on ignored images.
  - Wired to `GenerateScreen`'s "Chat with AI" panel, which (per earlier
    direct feedback that the chat gave no feedback while waiting and
    rendered raw markdown unreadably) shows an animated typing-dots bubble
    and switches the Send button to "Sending…" while `chatReply.isPending`,
    auto-scrolling the log so that's actually visible; renders assistant
    replies as real markdown (`react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` — chosen over
    a `marked`+`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` approach because it never renders
    raw HTML by default, no separate sanitizer needed); and extracts a
    finalized prompt the model wrapped in a `` ```final-prompt ``` `` fence
    (`llm.FINAL_PROMPT_FENCE`, mirrored in `chatMarkdown.ts`'s
    `parseChatMessage()`) into its own "Suggested prompt" card. See
    "Frontend" above for the **Use as AI-refined prompt** button both that
    card and the plain-message fallback use.

Both endpoints were dry-run tested against the live containerized DB and
Postgres (mocked only the outbound LLM HTTP call): config correctly
reports `llm_enabled: false` when unset; refine/chat correctly `503` when
unset; with a mocked LLM configured, refine returns a rewritten prompt and
a stateless chat call returns a reply with zero DB writes. Then, once a
real job-creation call included a `chat_transcript`, confirmed (real
Django test client, not just reasoning about the code) that a
`PromptChatSession` gets created *only* at that point, already correctly
linked via `resulting_job`, with all transcript messages persisted — and
confirmed the reverse too: chatting for real in a browser (against the
real LLM) with no job ever queued left zero `PromptChatSession` rows for
that user.

## Benchmarking render times

`RenderPreset.estimated_render_seconds` is currently a rough, unbenchmarked
guess (see its seed migration). `manage.py benchmark_render_times` sweeps
`(resolution, duration)` combinations per mode against the **real** ComfyUI
instance and records what happened into `BenchmarkResult` — the matrix you'd
actually curate `RenderPreset` rows from. It:

- Submits real jobs via the same `build_api_workflow()` `tasks.py` uses (no
  fake DB rows needed, since that function is pure).
- Measures wall-clock render time on success.
- Distinguishes a **clean server-side failure** (ComfyUI caught an error,
  e.g. OOM, and reported it via `/history` — `comfyui.check_for_error()`)
  from ComfyUI's **whole process dying**, which the user has observed happen
  in practice on large combinations, not just a graceful per-job error. The
  former records `oom_error` and moves to the next combination immediately
  (ComfyUI itself is fine, no need to wait for anything).
- **Built for genuinely unattended overnight runs**, per the user's actual
  operating setup: their ComfyUI is supervised by a process manager that
  auto-restarts it within roughly a minute of a crash. So a crash (detected
  via `is_alive()` before each attempt, and via a connection error
  mid-request) no longer stops the command: `_wait_for_restart()` polls
  `is_alive()` until it comes back (`--restart-timeout`, default 300s —
  generously above the observed ~1 minute) or gives up on that one
  combination if it doesn't; `_warm_up()` then submits a tiny 2s throwaway
  t2v render (never itself recorded) so the model is loaded/warm before the
  *next real* combination's timing is measured, rather than that
  combination unfairly eating a cold-start penalty; the combination that
  crashed is then **retried**, since it never actually completed and simply
  moving on would silently lose that data point. If a single combination
  keeps crashing ComfyUI (`--max-crash-retries`, default 3 retries — 4
  attempts total), it's given up on — recorded `crashed` — and the sweep
  moves on to the next combination, so one bad combination can't stall an
  entire overnight run. (Earlier version of this command stopped the whole
  sweep on any crash and required a manual restart + re-run — replaced
  after direct user feedback describing their actual auto-restart setup.)
- Is resumable: already-recorded combinations (including ones given up on)
  are skipped on a re-run (`--retest` to force) — useful both for a normal
  resume and for retrying a specific combination once you believe whatever
  made it crash is fixed.
- Sorts combinations cheapest-first (by `width × height × duration`) and
  defaults to a small built-in spread; both are overridable via
  `--resolution`/`--duration`/`--modes`/`--steps`.

**This is never run automatically by anything in this project** — it spends
real GPU time. It's a tool to run deliberately; its `--help` output,
argument parsing, and the new crash/restart/warm-up/retry/give-up logic
were all dry-run tested this pass (mocking `integrations.comfyui`'s network
calls to simulate a mid-request crash-then-recover cycle, a combination
that never stops crashing, and ComfyUI never coming back — see
"Verification" below), but the command has **not** been run for real
against live ComfyUI yet (same reason as the live ComfyUI test below — the
GPU server was busy) — i.e. a real `(resolution, duration)` sweep,
distinct from the one-off manual render that *has* been done, see
"Verification" below.

## Getting the workflows working: UI-format → API-format

`resources/workflows/*.json` are ComfyUI's **UI/editor format** — `POST
/prompt` needs the flat **API format** instead (see
`resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md` §3). Rather than requiring a manual
"Export (API)" click in ComfyUI's UI for each of the 3 workflows,
`backend/scripts/export_workflow_api.py` reimplements that export
mechanically: it reads a UI-format workflow plus live `/object_info`
responses from a running ComfyUI (cached in `scripts/object_info_cache/`),
and reconstructs the exact API-format JSON, including subgraph flattening
(t2v/i2v wrap their sampler chain in a "Image to Video (MiniMax H3)"
subgraph) and ComfyUI's dynamic reference-list inputs (r2v's
`ref_images.ref_image_N`, up to 9). The script's docstring documents each
serialization rule and exactly how it was verified against real saved
workflow JSON + live object_info from the actual ComfyUI instance this
project targets (`gpusun:8188`) — nothing about it is guessed. Its output
was cross-checked byte-for-byte reproducible and passed a full dry run
(patch every mode, confirm valid/well-wired JSON) against the live stack.

Run it again any time a workflow in `resources/workflows/` is edited in the
ComfyUI UI, to regenerate its `resources/workflows_api/*.api.json`
counterpart:

```
cd backend
uv run python scripts/export_workflow_api.py \
  ../resources/workflows/video_minimax_h3_t2v.json \
  ../resources/workflows_api/video_minimax_h3_t2v.api.json
```

`generation/tasks.py` then patches the resulting JSON's known node ids
directly (documented in `_T2V_I2V_NODES`/`_R2V_NODES` in that file) —
prompt, width/height (bypassing the workflow's own `ResolutionSelector`
node, which only accepts an aspect-ratio preset rather than arbitrary
dimensions), steps, duration (feeding the workflow's existing
seconds→frame-count snapping math rather than reimplementing it), a fresh
random seed per job, reference images (dynamically adding/wiring
`LoadImage` nodes per image `ReferenceAsset`, replacing the template's
example wiring), and — r2v only — reference audio (same pattern, dynamically
adding `LoadAudio` nodes per audio `ReferenceAsset`, wired into
`ref_audios.ref_audio_N`; confirmed against live `/object_info/LoadAudio`
and `/object_info/MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo` before implementing, see
"Verification" below) and reference video (`ref_videos.ref_video_N` +
`ref_video_audios.ref_video_audio_N`, both fed from the same uploaded clip
via `integrations/video_ref.py`'s `LoadVideo`→`GetVideoComponents` splice —
confirmed against live `/object_info/LoadVideo`/`/object_info/GetVideoComponents`,
see `resources/COMFYUI_API_GUIDE.md` §4). i2v's first/last-frame assignment
currently uses a plain convention (reference `order=0` → first frame,
`order=1` → last frame) since `ReferenceAsset` has no explicit role field
yet.

## Request/job flow

1. Browser hits `/invite/<token>/` (first-time users) or the OIDC login
   directly (existing users / trusted-provider auto-accept) → session
   cookie set on success. SPA calls `GET /api/me/` to know whether it has a
   session at all.
2. SPA calls `GET /api/config/` to decide whether to show any AI UI at all.
3. SPA calls `GET /api/presets/` to show mode/megapixels/duration/aspect-ratio
   options with estimated render time, and `GET /api/queue-estimate/?duration_id=`
   before the user confirms.
4. While drafting a prompt, the user may click "AI refine"
   (`POST /api/prompt/refine/`, one-shot) or open the chat
   (`POST /api/prompt/chat/`, multi-turn, stateless — see "LLM
   integration" below).
5. `POST /api/jobs/` creates a `GenerationJob` (raw + optionally the
   AI-refined prompt from step 4) plus any staged reference images/audio,
   snapshotting `estimated_seconds` from the chosen `RenderPreset`, and
   enqueues `generation.tasks.process_queue` via Django-Q2.
6. `process_queue()` claims and runs jobs strictly one at a time, FIFO
   (oldest `queued` first, system-wide, not just this user's), until the
   queue's empty; each claimed job runs the ComfyUI round trip (§ above)
   and ends `done` either way. The always-visible `QueueSidebar` polls
   `GET /api/jobs/` / `GET /api/jobs/{id}/` for progress, including each
   job's `expected_finish_time`; clicking an entry opens its `JobModal`
   (see "Frontend" above — queuing itself doesn't open anything).

All of the above is implemented and wired end to end, on both the API side
(`generation/api.py`, `accounts/api.py`) and the React side (see "Frontend"
above) — verified in a real browser session, including step 6's ComfyUI
round trip against the actual `gpusun` GPU box (see "Verification" below).

## Verification done so far vs. still outstanding

**FIFO/serialized job processing**, against the live containerized stack
(real Postgres, real Django-Q2 with `Q_CLUSTER_WORKERS=1`, ComfyUI itself
unreachable in this environment so every job fails fast at the
`comfyui.queue_prompt()` call -- fine for this purpose, since the point was
timing/ordering, not a real render): queued 4 jobs back to back via
`POST /api/jobs/`, then polled `GET /api/jobs/`. Confirmed from the
`started_at`/`finished_at` timestamps: strict FIFO order (each job's
`started_at` matches creation order) and zero overlap (every job's
`finished_at` precedes the next job's `started_at` -- no two jobs ever
"processing" at once). Also confirmed `expected_finish_time`'s cumulative
math directly: job *N+1*'s value at creation time equalled job *N*'s plus
the preset's `estimated_render_seconds`, exactly as `queue.expected_finish_times()`
specifies. (One job's create-response `expected_finish_time` came back
`null` -- a harmless race where that job finished, since it fails near-
instantly with no real ComfyUI, before the same request's own finish-time
lookup ran; can't happen with real multi-second-or-longer renders.)

**Frontend, in a real browser** (Playwright, driven against this project's
own docker-compose stack rebuilt with the current code, not a mock):
logged-out `/` correctly shows the login screen with no OIDC button (none
configured in the test env) and a working `/accounts/login/` link;
logged in with a manually-created superuser and landed back on the SPA
(this is what caught the `/accounts/profile/` 404 bug fixed above); Generate
screen loads real presets and preselects one; submitted a real
`POST /api/jobs/` and landed on `/jobs` with the new job visible and polling;
separately drove r2v's add/insert-token/remove reference flow and i2v's
first/last-frame slots directly. Zero browser console errors, zero
unexpected-status API responses across all of the above. The jobs
themselves then failed once `qcluster` tried to actually reach ComfyUI, as
expected in a sandbox with no real ComfyUI reachable — that's the same
never-tested-live-ComfyUI gap noted below, not a frontend or job-creation
bug (job creation, enqueueing, and status transition to `done` -- with
`error_message` set -- all worked correctly; this predates the FIFO/status
rework below but the same underlying flow, just renamed).

`generation/tasks.py` has been dry-run tested end-to-end for all three modes
against the live containerized Postgres DB: real `RenderPreset`/
`GenerationJob`/`ReferenceAsset` rows, `_build_workflow_for_job()` (which
calls the pure `build_api_workflow()`) run for real, only
`integrations.comfyui.upload_media` mocked (so no network/GPU cost) —
confirmed correct node wiring and valid, well-formed JSON for t2v (plain
text), i2v (first *and* last frame, which requires dynamically adding a
node the template doesn't have), and r2v (three dynamically-added reference
images replacing the template's example wiring, prompt correctly landing on
its separate `PrimitiveStringMultiline` node) — re-confirmed after the
`build_api_workflow()` extraction refactor. Also dry-run tested: `/api/config/`,
`/api/prompt/refine/`, and the full chat session flow (see "LLM integration"
above).

### A real live ComfyUI render has now actually been done

See [`FUNCTION_CHECK.md`](FUNCTION_CHECK.md) for the repeatable procedure
this came out of. Queued a real draft t2v job (`608×320`, `3s`, `8` steps)
against the actual `gpusun` GPU box with go-ahead to spend the GPU time:
queued → `processing` → `done`, a real ~126KB valid `.mp4` came back
(`ftypisom` header confirmed), `error_message` empty, and ComfyUI's own
`/history` for that prompt was empty afterward (`clear_history()` worked).
Took ~71s wall-clock against that preset's `estimated_render_seconds: 30`
guess — one real data point, consistent with those numbers being
unbenchmarked as documented; not enough on its own to justify overwriting
the seeded estimate, that's still `benchmark_render_times`'s job. Two real
bugs surfaced and got fixed doing this, neither in the render path itself:
`RenderPreset`'s `r2v`/non-draft row was missing from the database (present
in the seed migration, just not present in the actual table — see
"generation" above) and `.env`'s `COMFYUI_BASE_URL` used the `gpusun`
hostname, which the containers can't resolve even though the Docker host
can (see "Docker Compose service graph" above) — fixed to the machine's IP.
The full Playwright browser pass (login → Generate → r2v/i2v reference
flows → submit → Queue screen) was also independently re-run this pass, not
just carried over from an earlier claim — see "Frontend, in a real browser"
above; that predates this update and still describes what was checked.

A real `benchmark_render_times` run — actually sweeping the
resolution/duration matrix rather than one manual job — has **still not**
been done; see "Deferred" below.

### Resolution/length UI redesign + a real `/media/` 404 bug fixed

Triggered by user-reported feedback after the pass above: the old
preset-card picker was too big for too few options, and generated videos
404'd on the Queue screen. Two independent fixes:

- **`/media/` 404**: `config/urls.py` never actually mounted a URL pattern
  for `MEDIA_URL` at all — not a `DEBUG`-only gap, since
  `django.contrib.staticfiles` only ever auto-serves `STATIC_ROOT`, never
  `MEDIA_ROOT`. Every `video_url` the API returned was dead on arrival.
  Fixed with an unconditional `re_path(...serve_static...)` mount (see
  "Backend apps" above); verified with `curl` through nginx returning 200
  with correct video bytes where it 404'd before.
- **Resolution/length redesign**: replaced the flat `RenderPreset(width,
  height, duration_seconds, estimated_render_seconds)` card list with
  `RenderPreset` as a megapixels/steps quality tier (now including a
  `is_draft` "Draft" tier) and a new `RenderDuration` model FK'd to it
  holding per-tier, per-duration curated estimates, plus a standalone
  `resolution.py` computing width/height from megapixels + aspect ratio
  (aspect ratio doesn't affect render time, so it's a separate axis, not
  baked into the preset). `GenerationJob` snapshots `megapixels`,
  `aspect_ratio`, `width`, `height`, and `duration_seconds` directly at
  queue time (not just reachable via the `duration` FK), so later admin
  edits to the catalog never retroactively change values already shown to a
  user. See "generation" and "api.py/urls.py" above for the full shape.
  Migrating this required splitting data cleanup from schema changes across
  three migration files (`0007`/`0008`/`0009`) after hitting a real
  Postgres error — `cannot ALTER TABLE ... because it has pending trigger
  events` — from combining a `RunPython` delete and a `NOT NULL`
  `AlterField` in the same transaction; each migration file is its own
  transaction, so splitting the delete into its own file first let it
  commit before the later `ALTER TABLE` ran.

Verified at three levels: direct Django-ORM/API dry-run testing of the new
`duration_id`/`aspect_ratio` job-creation path and `compute_resolution()`'s
output across several megapixel/ratio combinations (all sane, rounded to
the required multiple of 32); a synthetic file-serving test confirming the
`/media/` 404 fix; and a real Playwright browser pass against the rebuilt
stack — quality/aspect-ratio dropdowns and the length slider all update the
displayed estimate correctly (confirmed the slider drives real React state
via keyboard interaction, not just a visual thumb position), matching the
seeded catalog data exactly.

### Frontend redesign (`frontend fixes.txt`) + `ref_audio_N` wiring + job delete

Backend: `ref_audio_N` wiring was live-verified against the
actual ComfyUI instance before writing any code — queried
`/object_info/LoadAudio` (confirmed its only input is `audio`, COMBO/
filename-based, identical shape to `LoadImage.inputs.image`) and
`/object_info/MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo` (confirmed `ref_audios` is a
`COMFY_AUTOGROW_V3` group, `prefix: "ref_audio_"`, `min: 0, max: 3`,
structurally identical to the already-wired `ref_images` group) — so the
implementation itself was a direct, low-risk mirror of existing
`ref_image_N` code, not exploration. Dry-run tested end to end: built a
real `GenerationJob` with both an image and an audio `ReferenceAsset`
against the live containerized DB (only `comfyui.upload_media` mocked) and
confirmed `_build_workflow_for_job()` produced correct
`ref_audios.ref_audio_N` wiring and valid `LoadAudio` nodes. The new
`DELETE /api/jobs/{id}/` was dry-run tested directly with Django's test
`Client` (not the browser) against real DB rows: 409 while `status ==
processing`, 204 (and the row actually gone) while `queued` — note this
needed `Client(SERVER_NAME='localhost')` to match this deployment's
`DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`; the test client's default `testserver` host is
rejected with a generic 400 otherwise, easy to mistake for a real bug.

Frontend: `npm run build` (tsc + vite) and `npm run lint` (oxlint) both
clean. Full Playwright browser pass against the rebuilt stack covering
every item in `frontend fixes.txt` plus the new audio references and
delete/redo flows — content-type tabs (`Image`/`Audio` disabled), mode-tab
switching, the toolbar still driving the queue estimate live, an uploaded
image reference rendering a thumbnail, an uploaded audio reference showing
in its own list, `<Picture N>` token insertion, submitting opening the job
modal automatically (`onJobCreated`), the queue sidebar showing a
prompt-derived title, the modal's Redo button repopulating the prompt, and
delete removing the sidebar entry (blocked with a 409-matching disabled
state while a job is processing) — 22/22 checks passed (skipped one
redundant re-run, see below), zero browser console errors.

One real near-miss caught and corrected during this pass: the environment's
`COMFYUI_BASE_URL` turned out to be genuinely reachable, so the Playwright
script's real `POST /api/jobs/` submission (needed to test the submit→modal
flow honestly) got picked up by `qcluster` and queued for a real render on
actual GPU hardware — without the explicit go-ahead this project's standing
rule requires. Caught by checking ComfyUI's own `GET /queue` directly
(confirmed the job's `comfyui_prompt_id` was only `queue_pending`, not yet
`queue_running` — i.e. sitting behind another, unrelated real job already
in progress, not itself consuming GPU time yet) and cancelled it via
`POST /queue {"delete": [prompt_id]}` before it could start. The
now-orphaned `GenerationJob` row was manually resolved to `done` with an
explanatory `error_message` (harmless — `_execute_job()`'s own eventual
timeout would have reached the same terminal state on its own, just up to
~8.5 minutes later per `job.estimated_seconds * 3 + 300`) so the FIFO queue
wasn't left stalled. The remaining delete-flow checks were then re-run
against that same now-resolved job instead of submitting a second real job.
Lesson for future passes in this specific environment: `COMFYUI_BASE_URL`
being reachable is the normal state here, not a rare edge case — any
browser-driven test that exercises real job submission needs this same
immediate-cancel treatment unless GPU time is explicitly wanted.

### `benchmark_render_times` made crash-resilient for unattended overnight runs

Prompted directly by the user: their ComfyUI is behind a
process manager that auto-restarts it within ~1 minute of a crash, and they
want to start the sweep and walk away, not babysit it. Rewrote the crash
path (`_run_combo_with_crash_recovery()`, `_wait_for_restart()`,
`_warm_up()` in the command) per "Benchmarking render times" above. Since
this needs a real crashing ComfyUI to test end-to-end honestly (out of
scope to actually trigger for a doc-verification pass), it was dry-run
tested by mocking `integrations.comfyui`'s network calls directly, three
scenarios, each run via `manage.py shell` against the real containerized
DB:

1. **Crash mid-request, then recovers**: `queue_prompt` raises a
   `ConnectionError` on the first call; `is_alive()` then reports down once
   and back up; `queue_prompt` succeeds on the retry (with a warm-up
   `queue_prompt` call in between). Confirmed exactly 3 `is_alive()` calls
   and 3 `queue_prompt()` calls in the right order, and a final `BenchmarkResult`
   of `ok` — proving the combination that crashed is the one that ends up
   recorded, not silently dropped.
2. **Combination that keeps crashing ComfyUI**: `queue_prompt` always
   raises; `is_alive()` always reports up (simulating a crash that's purely
   a mid-request connection drop, never actually caught by the pre-attempt
   check). With `max_crash_retries=3`, confirmed exactly 4 total attempts,
   then a clean `crashed` result and — critically — the method **returning
   normally rather than raising**, proving one bad combination can't halt
   the outer sweep loop.
3. **ComfyUI never comes back**: `is_alive()` always `False`. Confirmed
   `_wait_for_restart()` respects `restart_timeout` (didn't hang — returned
   within ~the configured bound in the test) and the combination is
   recorded `crashed` with a clear "did not come back within Ns" message.

All three matched the intended design. `manage.py check` clean after the
rebuild.

### Chat UX (feedback while waiting, markdown rendering, final-prompt extraction) + `LLM_API_KEY` wrongly required

Two separate user reports.
First: `settings.LLM_ENABLED`/`integrations.llm.is_configured()` both
required `LLM_API_KEY` truthy, so a user who configured a real, reachable,
key-less local LLM server still got no AI UI at all — fixed by dropping
`LLM_API_KEY` from both gates (see "LLM integration" above); verified for
real (not mocked) that `GET /api/config/` flips to `llm_enabled: true` and
`llm.improve_prompt()` succeeds against the user's actual server with no
`Authorization` header sent. Second, once that unblocked actually using
chat: no feedback while waiting, unrendered raw markdown, and no easy way
to pull the finished prompt out of a whole reply's worth of commentary —
addressed by the typing-indicator/markdown/final-prompt-extraction changes
above, verified end to end in a real browser against the same real LLM
(not mocked): typing indicator appears immediately and the Send button
reads "Sending…"; both disappear once the real reply lands; the reply
renders through `react-markdown`; the model reliably wrapped its finished
prompt in the requested `` ```final-prompt ``` `` fence (checked verbatim
model output, not assumed); the frontend correctly extracted it into its
own card with no raw fence syntax leaking into the visible text; clicking
**Use this prompt** filled the prompt textarea with exactly the extracted
text, no fence markers. 10/10 checks passed, zero console errors.

### Queuing no longer pops a modal + redo restores the AI-refined prompt

Two more direct user reports. First: submitting a job opened its
`JobModal` immediately (an earlier pass's `onJobCreated` callback) — the
user wanted queuing to just add the job to the sidebar and leave them on
the form, not interrupt with a popup; fixed by deleting `onJobCreated`
entirely (not left as a no-op) rather than adding a flag to suppress it.
Second: `redoJob`'s effect explicitly cleared `improvedPrompt` instead of
restoring `redoJob.improved_prompt` — redoing a job that had used AI refine
silently dropped the refinement. Verified end to end in a real browser
against the real, actually-configured LLM (not mocked): AI-refine a
prompt, queue it on the cheapest (Draft) tier, confirm no modal opens and
the sidebar picks it up reactively; open it explicitly, click Redo, confirm
both the raw prompt *and* the AI-refined block are restored verbatim.
Submitting during this check reached real ComfyUI and actually rendered
(no other job was ahead of it in ComfyUI's own queue this time, unlike the
earlier near-miss — see the frontend-redesign pass above — so there was no
`queue_pending` window to cancel it in before it started); let it finish
rather than interrupt a render already in progress, ~50s on the Draft tier.
Noted here for the same reason as before: `COMFYUI_BASE_URL` being
reachable in this environment means *any* real submission during a
browser-driven check can end up actually rendering, not just being queued.

### Redo also restores reference images/audio, not just prompt fields

Direct follow-up: "redo doesn't keep images" (reference files
were documented as a known limitation, not actually attempted). Implemented
`fetchAsFile()`-based restoration (see "Frontend" above) and, while
verifying it, caught and fixed a second real bug in the *same* redo
effect: the async restore was silently discarding every result because the
effect's own `onRedoConsumed()` call (setting `redoJob` back to `null`)
looked identical to a genuine supersede-by-a-newer-redo to a naive
cleanup-based cancellation guard. Fixed with an id-keyed ref instead. Both
verified together in a real browser against jobs seeded directly with real
reference files via Django shell (no ComfyUI call at all, avoiding another
accidental real render) — r2v redo restored both reference images (correct
filenames, correct order, thumbnails) and the audio reference; i2v redo
restored first *and* last frame. 7/7 checks passed, zero console errors.

### `/media/` is now actually access-controlled, not just unguessable

Direct follow-up in the same pass: unguessable filenames
stop *enumeration* but don't stop anyone who has, guesses, or otherwise
obtains one specific URL from fetching it with no login at all — the bare
`django.views.static.serve` mount only checked that a path existed on
disk. Flagged to the user as a distinct, larger change before building it
(rather than assumed) — confirmed wanted. New
`generation/media_views.py::serve_protected_media()` wraps the same
underlying `django.views.static.serve` (keeping its Range/ETag/
conditional-GET handling intact, needed for `<video>` seeking) behind a
check that the requesting `User` actually owns the `GenerationJob`
(`video_file` paths) or `ReferenceAsset`'s job (`references/` paths) the
requested path resolves to — looked up by an exact match against the
stored `FileField` value, dispatched by path prefix. Not authenticated, or
authenticated as someone else: `404`, matching the same not-found-rather-
than-forbidden convention `generation/api.py` already uses for cross-user
job access elsewhere, so a non-owner can't even tell the path exists.
Staff/superusers bypass the ownership check (not the auth check) since
`/admin/`'s own `FileField` widgets link straight to these same URLs, and
staff already has full DB read access regardless. Deliberately *not*
nginx `X-Accel-Redirect`: that would need `frontend` (nginx) to also mount
the `media_data` volume it currently has zero access to on purpose, for a
performance win this app's actual scale doesn't need — plain
Django-served responses match this project's existing bias toward the
simplest correct option (see `backend`'s whitenoise choice above). Verified
for real, not just reasoned about: created jobs with real files owned by
one user, confirmed with actual login sessions (not mocked) — no
session: `404`; owner: `200` with correct bytes; a different logged-in
user: `404`; a staff user (not the owner): `200`. Also verified the actual
`<video>` element in `JobModal` still resolves and would still play
(fetched its own `src` URL inside the same authenticated browser session)
— the ownership check doesn't accidentally break normal playback for the
owning user, only cross-user/anonymous access.

### Orphaned-job recovery after a restart, plus a real incident discovering it the hard way

Direct user report: a job was stuck showing
"Processing…" forever, correctly diagnosed as the result of a qcluster
restart landing mid-render — `_claim_next_job()` only ever claims `QUEUED`
jobs, so a `PROCESSING` job orphaned by a dead worker had nothing that
would ever pick it back up. Built `generation.tasks.recover_orphaned_processing_jobs()`
(called at the top of `process_queue()`, and once at qcluster container
startup via the new `manage.py recover_stale_jobs` — see
`docker-compose.yml`'s `qcluster` command) to actually recover the result
where possible rather than just discarding it: checks ComfyUI's
`/history` for the orphaned job's `comfyui_prompt_id` first (it may have
finished successfully while nothing was watching), then `/queue` (it may
genuinely still be rendering, in which case this resumes the wait rather
than abandoning real in-progress work), and only marks the job failed —
freeing it from blocking anything — once ComfyUI has no record of it at
all. New `integrations.comfyui.get_history()`/`is_prompt_queued()` back
those two checks; `_execute_job()`'s finalize-from-a-finished-prompt logic
was extracted into `_finish_job_from_history()` so both the normal path
and recovery share it exactly rather than duplicating it.

#### A real incident happened while testing this, worth recording in full

Dry-run testing the three recovery scenarios (found in history / still
queued / genuinely lost) by mocking `integrations.comfyui` and calling
`recover_orphaned_processing_jobs()` directly via `manage.py shell` against
the actual shared dev database. The function queries *every* `PROCESSING`
row with no scoping and no locking — it swept up two real jobs alongside
the intended synthetic test rows: one (id 41) had already finished
successfully on ComfyUI's side (confirmed after the fact: `status_str:
"success"`, a real output file) and got wrongly marked "lost" instead of
finalized; the other (id 47) was **still genuinely rendering** at that
exact moment (confirmed via `/queue`: `queue_running`) and got wrongly
marked "lost" mid-render — exactly the "a video that is still rendering
failed when it started up" the user then reported. This is not a flaw in
the recovery logic itself (a real, unmocked `is_prompt_queued()` call
would have correctly found job 47 still running and resumed waiting
instead) — it's that the function's only real safety invariant
(Q_CLUSTER_WORKERS=1 serializing it against a genuinely in-flight
`_execute_job()`) only holds at its two sanctioned call sites, and calling
it ad hoc from a shell sidesteps that entirely. Recovered both, but
differently once the actual state of each became clear: job 41's real,
already-finished result was fetched via `comfyui.get_history()` (unmocked)
and finalized through the same `_finish_job_from_history()` production
code path — real ~1.1MB `.mp4`, correct `ftypisom` header, confirmed. Job
47 was left completely alone (no further writes from this end at all) and
monitored via ComfyUI's own `/history`/`/queue` — it turned out the
*original* live qcluster worker (its container was never restarted during
any of this, only `backend`'s image was rebuilt) was still genuinely
blocked inside its own real, unmocked `wait_for_result()` call for that
exact job the whole time, and **self-healed it correctly on its own**
minutes later — real ~2.2MB `.mp4`, correct header, confirmed — including
correctly clearing ComfyUI's history entry as its own normal cleanup step
(which is *why* the prompt disappeared from `/history` when checked
later, initially and momentarily worrying: gone from history reads
identically to "ComfyUI crashed and lost it" and to "finished and cleaned
up successfully" — only the job's own DB row disambiguates the two). Both
jobs were left with the incorrect "Lost track…" `error_message` string
from the original mocked write, though — `_finish_job_from_history()`'s
`update_fields` doesn't touch that column, since that path assumes a
clean job with no prior error to clear — so both needed one direct
follow-up save clearing it by hand. Re-verified the recovery logic itself
correctly afterward with a properly scoped test: calling
`_recover_one_orphaned_job()` directly on one explicit, freshly-created
synthetic job object, never the all-`PROCESSING` sweep, with an explicit
pre/post assertion that no real job was ever in `PROCESSING` state around
the test. Added a loud, explicit warning to
`recover_orphaned_processing_jobs()`'s own docstring against ad hoc
invocation outside its two real call sites, recording this exact incident
as the reason.

### Standard tier + full 2–20s duration range, JobModal megapixels, nearest-duration reconciliation fix, and the chat rewrite (stateless + context-aware + vision-configurable, see "LLM integration" above)

All direct user requests batched into one pass. Migration `0012` verified for real: every tier
(including the new `Standard`) offers exactly the 19 durations 2–20s;
pre-existing jobs' `RenderDuration` FKs (`PROTECT`) confirmed untouched —
this migration only *adds* rows, never deletes/reseeds, specifically
because real jobs already existed against the old catalog by this point
(unlike earlier catalog passes, done before any real job did). The
duration-reconciliation fix and JobModal's megapixels display were both
verified in a real browser: the length slider's minimum/maximum read
2s/20s, and switching quality tiers correctly kept the exact same seconds
value selected (trivially true now that every tier offers the same range,
but the underlying nearest-match logic was also exercised and correct).
The full chat rewrite was verified in a real browser against the real,
actually-configured LLM (not mocked) end-to-end: opened chat with a draft
already typed in the main prompt box, sent one message, got back a real
reply that referenced the draft's content unprompted (proving the
raw-prompt-context wiring), clicked **Use as AI-refined prompt** and
confirmed the raw prompt box was untouched while the AI-refined block got
populated instead, and confirmed zero `PromptChatSession` rows existed for
that user afterward despite the real conversation (proving statelessness)
— the job-linked-persistence half of that same claim was verified
separately via a real (unmocked-LLM-response-shape, real DB) Django test
client call, per above. 12/12 real-browser checks passed (after
recognizing one apparent "failure" was the test script comparing a whole
label string including the *estimated render time* — which legitimately
differs between tiers — rather than just the *duration value*, which had
in fact stayed exactly the same), zero console errors.

## Deferred to the next pass

Intentionally not built in this pass:

- **A real `benchmark_render_times` run** — see above; a one-off manual
  render has now been done (proving the whole pipeline works end to end
  against real ComfyUI), but the actual resolution/duration sweep this
  command exists for hasn't — still deliberately not run without asking
  first, since larger combinations can crash the ComfyUI process.
- **i2v's first/last-frame role** — inferred from `ReferenceAsset.order`
  (0 = first, 1 = last) rather than an explicit field; fine for now since
  the frontend already presents this as two distinct slots ("First frame" /
  "Last frame"), worth an explicit field if that convention ever needs to
  change.
- **No frontend/API typegen** — `src/api/types.ts` is hand-maintained to
  match `generation/api.py`/`accounts/api.py`'s response shapes rather than
  generated from `/api/schema/`; fine at this size, worth automating if the
  API surface keeps growing.
- **Tests.**
- **Media/static serving at scale** — `/media/` is served directly by
  Django for now; moving it to nginx-volume serving or object storage is a
  follow-up once upload volume matters.
- **No deep link for the job modal** — opening a job's detail (`JobModal`)
  is plain component state in `App.tsx`'s `MainLayout`, not synced to the
  URL (no `?job=<id>`); a deliberate simplification, easy to add later if
  bookmarking/sharing a specific job's view turns out to matter.
- ~~Clip-chaining extras~~ — designed properly rather than bolted on: see
  **Director Mode** above (backend, LLM planning, assembly/export, and the
  frontend board UI are all built). Continuity itself is **verified
  working end to end against a real ComfyUI install** (real two-clip
  renders, both through raw ComfyUI calls and through the actual Director
  API, with visually near-identical frames at the join — see
  `extras.md#contex-loop`'s "Verified live" section). What's *not* yet
  verified against a real ComfyUI/LLM install: `plan_scenes()`'s actual
  output quality (the parsing/normalization path is exercised, but no real
  script has been fed through it end to end yet) and `assembly.py`'s
  concat filter against real multi-clip renders (built and reasoned
  through carefully, but not yet run against real rendered videos) — worth
  a real end-to-end pass before relying on either for something that
  matters.
- **A general "extras" plugin registry** — the current `COMFYUI_EXTRAS`
  mechanism (`config/settings.py`) is deliberately a single purpose-built
  boolean (`GenerationJob.use_spectrum`) plus one splice function
  (`integrations/spectrum.py`), not a registry or an admin-tunable parameter
  system, and it doesn't account for an extra in the render-time estimate
  (`generation/queue.py`) — see `extras.md`'s closing section for why. Worth
  factoring out once a second extra actually gets wired in. There's also no
  live *status page* — `manage.py check_extras`
  (`generation/management/commands/check_extras.py`) covers the CLI/admin
  diagnostic case (which of `COMFYUI_EXTRAS`' nodes are actually installed
  on the configured ComfyUI instance right now, via
  `integrations/comfyui.get_object_info()`); a `/manage` panel surfacing the
  same thing in the browser is still just an idea, not built.
