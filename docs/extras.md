# ComfyUI extras

Optional integrations beyond ComfyUI's official day-0 MiniMax H3 support
(see the [Required ComfyUI models](../README.md#required-comfyui-models)
section of the README) for the workflows this project drives. Most of these
are independent community `custom_nodes` projects; **Turbo** below is the
exception — as of the ComfyUI version this app currently targets, its two
nodes ship natively, so only its LoRA *weight files* (not any third-party
code) need adding.

**Non-native extras below are unaudited third-party Python packages that
ComfyUI loads and executes.** Review a project's source (not just its
README) before installing it into your ComfyUI instance, the same way you
would for any other `custom_nodes` package. This project verified that each
repo below is real and active (cross-checked against an independent
[`awesome-minimax-H3`](https://github.com/wildminder/awesome-minimax-H3) list
and, for Spectrum, an independent
[comfyui-wiki.com news post](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/news/2026-08-03-comfyui-spectrum-minimax-h3))
but has not audited any of their code.

**Spectrum**, **Turbo**, and **Contex Loop** (the last backing Director
Mode's clip continuation, not a `COMFYUI_EXTRAS` toggle — see
[below](#contex-loop--integrated-director-mode)) are actually wired into
this app; the older, separate Motion Context project is documented for
reference but not integrated — see [Why this stopped short of a full extras
registry](#why-this-stopped-short-of-a-full-extras-registry).

## Configuration

One env var, `COMFYUI_EXTRAS` (see `.env.example`), comma-separated
`slug` or `slug=N` tokens:

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *(slug absent)* | Off — not offered at all. |
| `slug` or `slug=0` | Optional — a toggle is shown to the user, unchecked by default. |
| `slug=1` | Optional — a toggle is shown, checked by default. |
| `slug=2` | Forced — always applied to every job, no toggle shown, not overridable per job. |

`spectrum` and `turbo` both do something, e.g.
`COMFYUI_EXTRAS=spectrum=1,turbo`. The level is enforced server-side
(`generation/api.py::_resolve_use_spectrum`/`_resolve_use_turbo`) regardless
of what a client sends.

### Checking what's actually installed

There's no live status page (see [Why this stopped short of a full extras
registry](#why-this-stopped-short-of-a-full-extras-registry)) — check from the CLI
instead, after setting `COMFYUI_EXTRAS` and before relying on it for a real
render:

```sh
docker compose exec backend python manage.py check_extras
```

For each configured extra, this hits the real ComfyUI instance's
`GET /object_info/<class_type>` and reports whether its node is actually
installed (ComfyUI answers `200 {}` for an unknown node type — it never
404s — so this checks the body, not the status code; confirmed against a
real instance). Also flags a `COMFYUI_EXTRAS` slug this app doesn't
recognize (almost always a typo), and a clear message if ComfyUI itself
isn't reachable at all.

## Spectrum — integrated

**[xmarre/ComfyUI-Spectrum-MiniMax-H3](https://github.com/xmarre/ComfyUI-Spectrum-MiniMax-H3)**
— spectral feature forecasting that skips some MiniMax H3 transformer
evaluations during sampling, to render faster. This is the actual subject of
the linked Reddit "45% lower sampler time" post (community reports put the
real-world range closer to ~24–30% depending on hardware/settings — see
Tradeoffs below).

### What it does

Fits a Chebyshev ridge model to the model's own recent hidden-feature history
and *forecasts* that feature on selected future sampler steps instead of
running the real transformer — every other part of the step (output heads,
video/audio reconstruction, sigma mapping) still executes normally. It's an
approximation, not a lossless shortcut.

Adds one node: **Spectrum Apply MiniMax H3** (`sampling/spectrum` category,
class type `SpectrumApplyMiniMaxH3`), a `MODEL → MODEL` wrapper meant to sit
right after the model loader (`... → Load Diffusion Model → [LoRA, if any] →
Spectrum Apply MiniMax H3 → guider/sampler`).

### Tradeoffs / known issues (from the project's own README)

- **Not bit-identical to native sampling.** Forecasted steps change the
  denoising trajectory. Two effects have been observed in exact-seed A/B
  testing: *trajectory deviations* (motion/pose/timing can diverge during
  fast or brief actions) and *localized quality degradation* (eyes, fingers,
  fine detail can become malformed or unstable when moving quickly or
  briefly visible). Either can occur alone or together.
- **Sampler allowlist.** Forecasting only applies for Euler, RES multistep,
  and RES multistep CFG++. Ancestral samplers and multi-GPU parallel
  sampling always run native (noise injection / unvalidated forecast
  transactions respectively).
- **Incompatible with EasyCache/LazyCache on the same model branch** — if
  both are attached, Spectrum logs a warning and stays inactive for that run
  rather than double-accelerating.
- **VRAM cost for history.** With `history_storage=vram` (not the default),
  retaining `max_history` snapshots can be multiple GiB at typical
  resolutions — `system_ram` (the default) avoids this at some transfer
  overhead cost.
- Requires native ComfyUI MiniMax H3 support introduced at ComfyUI commit
  `e377e263049f9338b4d12a3dd417b36ae62948ff` or later (including the
  `latent_shapes` argument on `outer_sample`); older ComfyUI revisions aren't
  supported.
- Adds no third-party Python dependency — only PyTorch and ComfyUI modules
  already present in a normal install.

### Install (in ComfyUI)

```sh
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/xmarre/ComfyUI-Spectrum-MiniMax-H3.git
```

Restart ComfyUI. The node appears under `sampling/spectrum` as **Spectrum
Apply MiniMax H3**.

### How this app wires it in

- `COMFYUI_EXTRAS=spectrum[=N]` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
- Frontend: a checkbox (or a static "always on" note at level 2) on the
  Generate screen, driven by `GET /api/config/`'s `spectrum_level`
  (`frontend/src/features/generate/GenerateScreen.tsx`).
- Backend: `GenerationJob.use_spectrum` is resolved and snapshotted at job
  creation (`generation/api.py::_resolve_use_spectrum`), then
  `backend/integrations/spectrum.py::apply_spectrum()` splices the node into
  the API-format workflow at render time
  (`generation/tasks.py::build_api_workflow()`) — it finds the workflow's
  sole `UNETLoader` node, rewires every existing reference to its output to
  the new Spectrum node instead, and wires the new node's `model` input back
  to the loader.
- Default node parameters are the project's own "preliminary default
  preset" verbatim: `blend_weight=0.5, degree=1, ridge_lambda=0.10,
  window_size=2.0, flex_window=0.75, warmup_steps=1, tail_actual_steps=1,
  max_history=8, history_storage=system_ram, bootstrap_first_forecast=true`.
  Not exposed as a per-job or admin-tunable setting yet — see [Why only one
  extra is wired up right now](#why-only-one-extra-is-wired-up-right-now).
- **Not accounted for**: `GenerationJob.estimated_seconds` (the number shown
  before queuing and used for the cross-user queue ETA, see
  `generation/queue.py`) is computed purely from the chosen preset/duration
  and does **not** shrink when Spectrum is on — the real render will be
  faster than the quoted estimate. The UI caption says as much rather than
  faking an adjustment.
- **Verify before first use**: the literal ComfyUI node class name
  (`SpectrumApplyMiniMaxH3`) is taken from the linked README and hasn't been
  confirmed against a live `/object_info` in this session. If it's ever
  wrong (e.g. a future release renames it), `apply_spectrum()` still
  succeeds — it's just building a dict — but ComfyUI's `/prompt` validation
  will reject the job with a clear unknown-node-type error, surfaced as the
  job's `error_message` like any other bad workflow.

**Tested with:** *not yet pinned — record the ComfyUI + Spectrum commit
hashes you validate this against here.* The project's own README documents
compatibility against ComfyUI commits `e377e263049f9338b4d12a3dd417b36ae62948ff`
(introduction) and `0dd9b154a1654fc699dcdc3af066c7cce096045a` (native-
equivalence CI), plus a community report confirming revision
`dc6291525112cb4246f864738e5bb4e2b85446da` on Windows 11 / ROCm 7.2.1 /
ComfyUI 0.30.0 — none of that was independently re-verified here.

## Contex Loop — integrated (Director Mode)

**[ethanfel/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Contex-Loop](https://github.com/ethanfel/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Contex-Loop)**
— chains MiniMax H3 clips together so motion and audio continue across the
join, the same problem the older, separate
[Motion Context](#motion-context--documented-not-integrated) project below
addresses, from a different author. Backs **Director Mode**'s clip
continuation (`Clip.continues_previous`, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`) — unlike
every other extra on this page, it isn't a `COMFYUI_EXTRAS`/`EXTRAS_CONFIG`
toggle: there's no per-job checkbox, it's attempted automatically whenever
a Director clip is flagged as continuing the one before it, with a
graceful fallback when it isn't installed (see below). **Working and
verified against a real install**, including two real end-to-end renders
where the extracted frames at the join were visually near-identical —
genuine continuity, not a guess (see "Verified live" below).

### What it does

The full extension is actually two layers:

- Its own **Plan → Loop Start → ... → Review Gate → Loop End → Assemble**
  node pipeline (`chain_nodes.py`), which normally runs a whole multi-scene
  chain as *one* ComfyUI graph submission (via `MiniMaxH3ChainLoopEnd`'s
  GraphBuilder recursion) and can include an interactive human-in-the-loop
  Review Gate (approve/retry/reroll) needing a live browser session against
  ComfyUI itself. **This app uses only part of this pipeline** — see below.
- An earlier version of this integration was built against four *different*,
  lower-level classes in the extension's `nodes.py` source
  (`MiniMaxH3MotionContext`/`LoopTrim`/`SaveLatent`/`LoadLatent`), modeled
  as a plain node-splice the same way `integrations/spectrum.py` splices
  Spectrum in. **That turned out to be wrong** — confirmed live
  (`GET /object_info/<class_type>` against a real install): only
  `MiniMaxH3LoopTrim` of those four is actually registered as a usable
  node; the other three exist in source but are never added to
  `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS`, so ComfyUI's `/prompt` validation rejected them
  as unknown node types every time. Left as a cautionary note for anyone
  reading this extension's source directly instead of its live
  `/object_info` — a repo's example workflows and internal helper classes
  aren't necessarily its current registered API.

### How this app actually wires it in

Uses the `chain_nodes.py` pipeline's non-interactive nodes directly, one
scene per ComfyUI submission — matching this app's existing one-job-per-clip
queue, *not* the extension's own whole-chain-in-one-graph model:

- **`MiniMaxH3ChainPlan`** — takes a `plan_json` (`{"prompt_prefix": ...,
  "shots": [{"id", "prompt"}, ...]}`), a `run_name` (identifies the
  checkpoint folder under ComfyUI's `output/h3_chains/`), a
  `generation_fingerprint` (a constant this app sets,
  `integrations/motion_context.py::GENERATION_FINGERPRINT` — bump it if
  the underlying model/settings ever change incompatibly), and the shared
  width/height/steps/duration/seed-base settings for the whole run.
- **`MiniMaxH3ChainLoopStart(plan, start_clip=N, scene_range="N")`** —
  `scene_range` limited to a single scene number renders exactly that one
  scene and terminates normally; `MiniMaxH3ChainLoopEnd`
  (recursion) and `MiniMaxH3ChainReview` (interactive) are never wired at
  all. `start_clip > 1` loads and validates the preceding scene's saved
  checkpoint — confirmed live, including the exact error when it's missing.
- **`MiniMaxH3ChainCurrent(state)`** — its `prompt`/`noise_seed`/`length`/
  `steps`/`width`/`height` outputs replace whatever `build_api_workflow()`
  already set on the mode's own sampler-prep node (i2v/r2v) and
  `RandomNoise`/`BasicScheduler` — the plan-resolved values (shared prompt
  + this scene's prompt, the H3-valid frame count including any
  continuation overlap, a run-consistent seed) are what must actually
  drive the render, not this job's own raw fields.
- **`MiniMaxH3ChainContext(state, conditioning, vae, latent, audio_vae)`**
  — replaces the sampler-prep node's conditioning going into `BasicGuider`;
  all context-loading logic (frames/audio/latent from the checkpoint) is
  encapsulated inside `state`, not wired by hand.
- **`MiniMaxH3LoopTrim`** — same as originally designed, removes the
  duplicated leading frames/audio; this app's own `CreateVideo`/`SaveVideo`
  nodes are fed from its trimmed output, completely unmodified from a
  normal (non-Director) render.
- **`MiniMaxH3ChainSegmentSave(state, images, sampled_latent, audio)`** —
  persists the checkpoint. Runs purely for that side effect: it also
  writes its own H.264 segment file, but this app never reads it, only its
  own `SaveVideo` output (confirmed live — both nodes' outputs appeared
  side by side in the same `/history` record, independently downloadable).
  Every Director-rendered clip gets this (even a fresh, non-continuation
  scene), so a *later* clip always has something to resume from if it
  turns out to want to.

See `director/services.py::_resolve_chain_params()` for how `run_name` and
each scene's 1-based position (`Clip.chain_run_name`/`chain_scene_number`)
are tracked and how the `shots` list (every scene from the start of the
current continuation run up to the one being rendered, using each Clip's
*current* prompt) is rebuilt fresh on every render — the plan is
validated/hashed as a whole on each submission (confirmed live), not
incrementally.

### Verified live

Before writing any of the above into this app, the whole mechanism was
tested directly against ComfyUI's HTTP API (bypassing Django entirely):

1. A **free** (no GPU) `Plan → LoopStart → Current` resolution-only
   submission confirmed the `plan_json` format, exact per-scene frame-count
   math (raw vs. delivered frames, the `context_length` overlap), and
   prompt concatenation, before spending any render time.
2. A **real render** of scene 1 (low steps, 2s clip) succeeded, and
   `MiniMaxH3ChainSegmentSave` wrote a real checkpoint;
   this app's own `SaveVideo` output was independently downloadable, as
   expected.
3. Submitting scene 2 with `start_clip=2` **without** a checkpoint present
   failed with an exact, informative `FileNotFoundError` naming the
   missing metadata path — confirming resume validation is real, not a
   no-op.
4. A **real render** of scene 2, resuming from scene 1's checkpoint,
   succeeded. Extracting scene 1's last frame and scene 2's first
   delivered frame and viewing them side by side showed them **visually
   near-identical** (same subject position, same background) — genuine
   motion continuity, not a coincidence of similar prompts.
5. The same sequence was then repeated end-to-end through the real
   Director API (project → two clips → render → render, not raw ComfyUI
   calls), confirming `run_name`/scene-number tracking, the `shots` list,
   and the auto-advance signal all work together correctly. This pass is
   also what caught two real bugs, both fixed before this was considered
   done:
   - `Clip.chain_run_name`/`chain_scene_number` were being set optimistically
     at job-*creation* time rather than after actual success — a failed
     render could leave a later clip trusting a checkpoint that was never
     saved. Now only set by `director/signals.py`'s `on_job_finished` on
     confirmed success.
   - i2v's `first_frame` is a real input on the underlying sampler-prep
     node regardless of Director's own continuity mechanism (Context only
     wraps its *conditioning* output, it doesn't supply `first_frame`
     itself) — a continuation clip with no image reference of its own
     left the template's placeholder-example `LoadImage` wiring in place,
     which ComfyUI's validation correctly rejected. Fixed by always
     defaulting an i2v continuation's `first_frame` to the predecessor's
     last frame when the user hasn't supplied one, independent of whether
     full continuity or the fallback is active.

### Install (in ComfyUI)

```sh
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/ethanfel/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Contex-Loop.git
```

Restart ComfyUI and hard-refresh the browser if you ever use its own UI.
Optional ffmpeg on PATH (falls back to PyAV) — irrelevant to this app's own
usage, which never touches that extension's own Plan/Assemble/Review nodes.

### Graceful fallback

Director Mode never requires this extension to be installed — availability
is detected live (`integrations/motion_context.py::is_available()`, a
cached `GET /object_info/MiniMaxH3ChainLoopStart` check, also surfaced to
the frontend via `GET /api/config/`'s `director_full_continuity_available`)
and degrades automatically rather than failing or disabling continuation:

- **Not installed at all**, or **a continuation clip's immediate
  predecessor has no real checkpoint of its own** (rendered before the
  extension was available, or itself fell back) — a `continues_previous`
  clip falls back to feeding the previous clip's **last frame** in as an
  ordinary image reference (i2v's `first_frame`, or r2v's first
  `<Picture N>`) instead of true motion/audio continuity — a much weaker
  technique (no audio carries over, and motion restarts from a single
  still frame rather than flowing continuously) but still a real visual
  anchor, and it needs nothing beyond what this app already keeps (the
  rendered `video_file` every job downloads regardless — see
  `integrations/media_post.py::extract_last_frame()`).
- **Self-healing at scene-start boundaries**: availability is re-checked on
  every render, not just once — the next *fresh* (non-continuation) Clip
  rendered always starts a brand-new full-continuity run if the extension
  is available by then, regardless of how any earlier part of the project
  rendered. A continuation Clip specifically inherits real continuity only
  when its immediate predecessor has it too, so a chain that fell back
  stays on the fallback until a fresh scene restarts it — not a per-clip
  toggle, a property of where each continuation run began.
- Director Mode itself is never disabled by the extension being absent —
  every other capability (multi-clip sequencing, dirty-cascade re-render,
  shared project prompt/resources) works identically either way; only the
  quality of a `continues_previous` join degrades.

## Turbo — integrated

A turbo LoRA + a per-stream (video/audio) sigma-shift, rendering MiniMax H3
in a handful of sampling steps instead of ~20. This app originally looked at
**[Larryvrh/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo](https://github.com/Larryvrh/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo)**
(a third-party turbo LoRA + a custom sampler node, kept below for context)
but the ComfyUI instance this app now targets ships the equivalent
functionality **natively** — a stock `LoraLoaderModelOnly` node plus one new
built-in node (`MiniMaxH3SigmaShift`) reproduce the same effect without any
extra `custom_nodes` install, confirmed directly against a live instance's
`GET /object_info` (Aug 2026). This app wires in the native pair, not the
third-party extension.

### What it does

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| `LoraLoaderModelOnly` (stock) | `MODEL → MODEL`, applies a turbo-distilled LoRA -- one of two checkpoints available on the configured instance's `lora_name` combo, `minimax_h3_fl2v_turbo_8step_v1.0_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` for t2v/i2v, `minimax_h3_ref2v_turbo_4step_v0.1_comfyui_bf16.safetensors` for r2v (each trained against that mode's own base checkpoint). |
| `MiniMaxH3SigmaShift` | `MODEL → MODEL`, sets separate video/audio flow-shift values (`shift_video=12.0`, `shift_audio=3.0` by default) so the two streams denoise on their own schedule instead of one shared one, which is what keeps audio from distorting at a low step count. |

Same underlying problem the third-party extension's custom sampler solved
(see below) -- MiniMax H3 denoises video and audio on two different flow
schedules, and a single shared schedule over-steps (distorts) the audio at
only 4-8 steps -- just solved natively now instead of via a bespoke sampler
node.

### Tradeoffs / known issues

- Each turbo LoRA is trained for a specific step count (8 for t2v/i2v, 4 for
  r2v, per `settings.TURBO_STEPS_T2V_I2V`/`TURBO_STEPS_R2V`) -- running at a
  different step count loses most of the benefit or leaves quality on the
  table. This app overrides the job's steps entirely rather than treating it
  as a normal preset dial (see "How this app wires it in" below).
- Same expected quality tradeoff as any step-distilled LoRA: faster, but
  typically softer/less consistent than a full ~20-step render, especially
  on fast motion or fine detail. Not independently benchmarked by this
  project against the specific checkpoints above.
- Combining with Spectrum (both toggles on for the same job) is untested --
  see the ordering note in "How this app wires it in" for what graph shape
  results; nothing in either extension's own docs flags an incompatibility.

### Install (in ComfyUI)

Nothing extra to install if your ComfyUI version already has native MiniMax
H3 Turbo support (confirmed by `check_extras` -- see below) -- just place
the two `.safetensors` files above under `ComfyUI/models/loras/`.

### How this app wires it in

- `COMFYUI_EXTRAS=turbo[=N]` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
- Frontend: a checkbox (or a static "always on" note at level 2) on the
  Generate screen, driven by `GET /api/config/`'s `turbo_level` plus
  `turbo_steps_t2v_i2v`/`turbo_steps_r2v` for the step-count caption
  (`frontend/src/features/generate/GenerateScreen.tsx`).
- Backend: `GenerationJob.use_turbo` is resolved at job-creation time
  (`generation/api.py::_resolve_use_turbo`), which also overrides the job's
  `steps` snapshot to `settings.TURBO_STEPS_T2V_I2V`/`TURBO_STEPS_R2V`
  instead of the chosen preset's own `steps` -- turbo isn't a quality dial
  the way a normal preset is, it only makes sense at the step count its LoRA
  was trained for. `backend/integrations/turbo.py::apply_turbo()` then
  splices the LoRA + sigma-shift nodes into the API-format workflow at
  render time (`generation/tasks.py::build_api_workflow()`), same
  find-the-loader-and-rewire mechanic as `integrations/spectrum.py`.
- **Splice ordering with Spectrum**: `build_api_workflow()` calls
  `apply_spectrum()` before `apply_turbo()` -- backwards from how that reads,
  but each function rewires *everything currently downstream* of the loader
  to sit after its own new node, so the one called **last** ends up
  **closest** to the loader in the resulting graph. Spectrum-then-turbo
  produces `loader → turbo LoRA → turbo SigmaShift → Spectrum →
  guider/sampler`, matching Spectrum's own recommended shape (`model loader
  → [LoRA, if any] → Spectrum → guider/sampler`); the reverse call order
  still produces a valid, non-cyclic graph, just with Spectrum sitting
  directly on the loader instead.
- Not accounted for: same as Spectrum, `GenerationJob.estimated_seconds`
  does not shrink when turbo is on -- the real render is faster than the
  quoted estimate, and the frontend hint says so rather than faking an
  adjustment.
- `manage.py check_extras` (see [Configuration](#configuration)) checks both
  node classes *and*, turbo-specifically, that both LoRA `.safetensors`
  files actually show up in `LoraLoaderModelOnly`'s live `lora_name`
  options -- the node classes themselves are stock/native and will report
  "installed" regardless of whether the weight files were ever downloaded,
  so that's the more useful check for this particular extra.

### Superseded: Larryvrh/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo

**[Larryvrh/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo](https://github.com/Larryvrh/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo)**
— the third-party project this app originally evaluated before the native
nodes above existed on its configured instance. Two nodes, meant to drop
into the official t2v/i2v workflow: **MiniMax-H3 Turbo LoRA** (`MODEL →
MODEL`, applies the [turbo LoRA](https://huggingface.co/larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora))
and **MiniMax-H3 Turbo Sampler (4-step)** (`→ SAMPLER`, a custom
per-stream sampler replacing whatever fed `SamplerCustomAdvanced`'s
`sampler` input). Its own README describes the current LoRA checkpoint
(`ckpt850`) as preview-quality (plastic-looking skin, over-sharp grain;
training paused pending a fix) and documents a `low_vram` runtime-vs-merged
tradeoff and a `strength` sharpness dial (~0.8–1.2). Kept here for reference
only -- this app does not install or wire this extension in; see "How this
app wires it in" above for what it uses instead.

## Motion Context — documented, not integrated

**[NikoDemon80/ComfyUI-H3-Motion-Context](https://github.com/NikoDemon80/ComfyUI-H3-Motion-Context)**
— chains MiniMax H3 clips together so motion **and audio** continue across
the join, instead of each clip re-deciding content from a single still
frame. The same underlying problem
[Contex Loop](#contex-loop--integrated-director-mode) above (a different,
later project) solves and which this app actually integrates — this one
remains just documented for reference, not integrated; no reason to run
both.

### What it does

H3's keyframe system tags frames with a time coordinate and re-injects them
at every sampling step; ComfyUI's stock implementation only allows keyframe
anchors at the first/last frame. This project lifts that restriction (self-
testing its own math against ComfyUI's at every startup) so a *run* of
consecutive frames from the end of one clip can anchor the start of the
next — and separately carries the previous clip's *audio* onto the new
clip's own timeline (rather than through H3's reference mechanism, which the
model treats as "a separate clip that sounds similar," not a continuation).

Four nodes: **H3 Motion Context** (feeds previous-clip frames/audio into
generation), **H3 Motion Context Trim** (removes the duplicated head
frames/audio before concatenating), and an **H3 Motion Context Save/Load
Latent** pair (carries the previous clip's *latent* across separate runs,
since ComfyUI won't let you wire a sampler's own output back into its next
run directly — "circular connection").

### Tradeoffs / known issues

- **Audio quality degrades down a chain.** Each clip's audio is regenerated
  from the previous clip's *output*, so — like photocopying a photocopy —
  losses compound; the top end goes first, so a long chain gets noticeably
  duller/muffled even though timing/tempo stay locked. Wiring the
  `context_latent` input (instead of just decoded `context_audio`)
  eliminates one of the two loss sources (an extra audio-VAE round trip) but
  not the model's own regeneration smoothing.
- **A small constant ~10ms audio offset**, below lip-sync perceptibility,
  that doesn't grow down the chain.
- **Narrow testing**: verified on two material types (dense electronic
  music, spoken word) on one Windows machine, one resolution, one sampler.
- **Incompatible with step-skipping optimizers** on the same graph — the
  README explicitly calls out disabling `ComfyUI-Spectrum-MiniMax-H3` for
  Motion Context graphs, since pinned rows never evolve, which is a
  degenerate case for Spectrum's forecaster. (Confirms the two extensions
  are not meant to be combined.)
- **Licensing caveat from the project's own README**: "The H3 community
  license reportedly does not currently cover the EU, UK, Korea, or the
  US. Verify independently before building anything shipping on this."
  Not verified here — treat as a pointer to check, not a legal conclusion.

### Install (in ComfyUI)

Drop the folder into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` and restart. Watch the console
for `h3_motion_context: interior keyframe anchors enabled` /
`h3_motion_context: keyframe/ref coexistence enabled` — if a self-test fails
instead, the node refuses to run rather than silently rendering something
wrong.

### Why not yet integrated

Unlike Spectrum and Turbo, this isn't a per-job workflow patch at all — it's
a **stateful, multi-job feature**: "continue this specific previous clip."
This app didn't originally support that shape of feature at all (no
"continue from job X" concept anywhere in the data model — `GenerationJob`
had no notion of a parent job — or UI); that gap is what Director Mode was
designed to fill (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`), using
[Contex Loop](#contex-loop--integrated-director-mode) above rather than
this project. Nothing rules out wiring this one in too later if Contex
Loop ever turns out to have a dealbreaker Motion Context doesn't, but
there's no reason to maintain two integrations of the same underlying
capability today.

## Why this stopped short of a full extras registry

This project went through a few design passes on how much "extras"
infrastructure to build up front — preset-level configuration (rejected: it
would duplicate a preset row per quality-tier × extras combination),
then a fuller plugin registry with admin-tunable per-extra time-estimate
profiles. The decision was to hold off on generalizing until there's a
second real extra to generalize *from* — Spectrum shipped first as a single
purpose-built boolean (`GenerationJob.use_spectrum`) and a single splice
function (`integrations/spectrum.py::apply_spectrum`), deliberately not a
registry.

Turbo (above) is that second extra, and it *did* reuse the same shape
almost exactly -- `GenerationJob.use_turbo`, `_resolve_use_turbo` mirroring
`_resolve_use_spectrum`, `integrations/turbo.py::apply_turbo` using the same
find-the-loader-and-rewire mechanic as `apply_spectrum` -- which is a decent
signal the shape holds up. The one thing it needed that Spectrum didn't is a
per-job steps override (turbo's LoRA is only useful at the step count it was
trained for, unlike Spectrum which layers on top of whatever steps the
preset already specifies) -- handled ad hoc in `generation/api.py`'s
job-creation view rather than a generalized "extra can override job fields"
mechanism. A third extra needing its own novel hook (not just "splice a
node in") would be the point to factor out a real registry rather than
keep extending this by hand.
