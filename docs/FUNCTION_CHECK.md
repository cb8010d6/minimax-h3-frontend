# Function check

A repeatable procedure for verifying the app actually works end to end —
API first (fast, scriptable, no browser needed), then the frontend in a real
browser. Written so it can be re-run after any change without re-deriving
what "working" means each time. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for
*why* things are built this way; this doc is just the *how do I know it
still works* checklist.

## 0. Before you start

- Stack must be running the **current** code: `docker compose up -d --build`
  (rebuilds anything changed; safe to run even if nothing changed).
- Check `docker compose exec backend python manage.py showmigrations` has no
  unapplied (`[ ]`) migrations — `migrate` should have applied everything on
  startup, but confirms it if you're unsure the rebuild actually landed.
- Know your `COMFYUI_BASE_URL` (`.env`) and whether it's actually reachable
  right now (`curl -m 5 <that-url>/system_stats` — expect a JSON body with
  `"system"`/`"devices"` keys). If it's not reachable, a job that reaches
  ComfyUI just ends `done` with `error_message` set — itself correct,
  expected behavior, not a check failure, for every step in §1-§2.
  **If it *is* reachable, §2 step 6 (a real browser submit) is itself real
  GPU-queuing, not just job creation** — `qcluster` picks it up immediately
  and gets a real `queue_prompt()` accepted. This has bitten a prior pass:
  don't assume §2 is automatically safe just because §1's API-level checks
  are. Either get the same explicit go-ahead §4 requires before doing step
  6, or immediately cancel the resulting job afterward: check
  `GET <COMFYUI_BASE_URL>/queue` for the job's `comfyui_prompt_id` (pull it
  via `manage.py shell` — not exposed over the API), and if it's only in
  `queue_pending` (not yet `queue_running`), cancel with
  `POST <COMFYUI_BASE_URL>/queue {"delete": [prompt_id]}` before it starts,
  then resolve the now-orphaned job to `done` via shell rather than letting
  it time out on its own (~`estimated_seconds * 3 + 300` later). Only
  attempt §4 itself (a real full render) with the same go-ahead — see that
  section.
- Know whether `LLM_API_BASE_URL`/`LLM_API_KEY`/`LLM_MODEL` and the `OIDC_*`
  vars are set in `.env` — several steps below branch on this
  (`GET /api/config/` tells you definitively; don't guess from `.env.example`).

## 1. API-level check (no browser needed)

Everything here uses a Django test client from `manage.py shell` (or
equivalent `curl` calls with a real cookie jar) — it exercises the exact
same view code a browser session would, without needing to drive one.
Create one throwaway user for this and delete it at the end (§1.11).

### 1.1 Public/meta endpoints (no login required)

```
GET /api/health/          -> 200 {"status": "ok"}
GET /api/config/          -> 200 {"llm_enabled": bool, "oidc_enabled": bool,
                                   "oidc_login_url": str|null, "oidc_provider_name": str}
GET /api/me/ (logged out) -> 200 {"authenticated": false}
```

If `oidc_enabled` is `true`, confirm `oidc_login_url` is a real path (starts
`/accounts/`) — that's what the frontend's login button points at.

### 1.2 Auth gate

Every other `/api/` endpoint below requires a session. Confirm the gate
itself works before testing what's behind it:

```
GET /api/presets/ (no session) -> 403
```

Then create a session (log in as a throwaway superuser via
`Client.force_login(user)` in a shell, or through `/accounts/login/` with
real credentials) and confirm:

```
GET /api/me/ (logged in) -> 200 {"authenticated": true, "id", "username", "email"}
```

### 1.3 Presets

```
GET /api/presets/            -> 200, list covering all 3 modes (t2v/i2v/r2v),
                                 each with is_draft true and false variants and
                                 a non-empty nested "durations" list
GET /api/presets/?mode=t2v   -> 200, only t2v presets
GET /api/presets/?mode=bogus -> 400
```

If the list is empty, the seed migration
(`generation/migrations/0009_seed_resolution_duration_catalog.py`) didn't
run — that's a setup problem, not a code problem; re-check §0.

### 1.4 Queue estimate

```
GET /api/queue-estimate/                          -> 200, seconds_ahead reflects
                                                       current backlog, additional_seconds: 0
GET /api/queue-estimate/?duration_id=<a real id>  -> 200, additional_seconds equals
                                                       that duration's estimated_render_seconds,
                                                       total_seconds = seconds_ahead + additional_seconds
GET /api/queue-estimate/?duration_id=999999       -> 404
```

### 1.5 Prompt-assist (skip if `llm_enabled` is `false`)

Chat is a single stateless endpoint (no session id, no DB persistence
during the live conversation at all — see `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "LLM
integration") — `history` is JSON-encoded and sent by the *caller* each
time, matching what the frontend already keeps in React state:

```
POST /api/prompt/refine/ {mode, raw_prompt}                       -> 503 when llm_enabled=false
POST /api/prompt/refine/ {mode: "bogus", raw_prompt: "x"}          -> 400
POST /api/prompt/chat/ (multipart) {mode, history: "[]", content}  -> 200 {role: "assistant", content}
POST /api/prompt/chat/ {mode, history: "not json", content}        -> 400
```

Confirm no `PromptChatSession`/`PromptChatMessage` rows get created by the
chat call above at all (check via shell) — that's the point of it being
stateless. Then confirm the *other* half of the persistence design: queue
a job (§1.6) with a `chat_transcript` field (JSON-encoded array of
`{role, content}`) attached, and confirm exactly one `PromptChatSession`
now exists, already linked via `resulting_job` to that job, with all
transcript messages persisted — chat only ever reaches the DB by riding
along with an actual job creation, never on its own.

If `llm_enabled` is `true` and you don't want to spend a real LLM call,
mock `requests.post` (see the dry-run pattern from earlier passes: patch
`integrations.llm._post_chat_completion`'s underlying `requests.post`) —
the point of this check is the Django plumbing (auth, persistence-timing,
503 gating), not the LLM's actual output quality.

### 1.6 Job creation (all three modes)

For each mode, `POST /api/jobs/` as multipart form data and confirm `201`
with a `GenerationJob` body (`status: "queued"`, `expected_finish_time` set,
`references` matching what you sent):

- **t2v**: `{mode: "t2v", duration_id, aspect_ratio, raw_prompt}` — no files.
- **i2v**: `{mode: "i2v", duration_id, aspect_ratio, raw_prompt}` +
  `reference_images` = 1 file (first frame only) — confirm
  `references[0].label == "Picture 1"`. Repeat with 2 files (first + last
  frame).
- **r2v**: `{mode: "r2v", duration_id, aspect_ratio, raw_prompt}` +
  `reference_images` = 2-3 files — confirm each gets `"Picture N"` labels in
  order. Also, separately, `reference_audio` = 1-3 files — confirm each gets
  `"Audio N"` labels; t2v/i2v reject any `reference_audio` (max is 0 for
  both).

Also confirm the created job's `width`/`height` match
`resolution.compute_resolution(preset.megapixels, aspect_ratio)` and that
`megapixels`/`duration_seconds` on the job match the `RenderDuration`/
`RenderPreset` rows `duration_id` pointed at (all snapshotted at creation
time, not just reachable via `duration_id`).

Also confirm the reference-count caps are enforced server-side (not just in
the frontend):

```
POST /api/jobs/ {mode: "t2v", ...} + 1 reference_images file   -> 400 (t2v allows 0 images)
POST /api/jobs/ {mode: "i2v", ...} + 3 reference_images files  -> 400 (i2v allows at most 2 images)
POST /api/jobs/ {mode: "r2v", ...} + 10 reference_images files -> 400 (r2v allows at most 9 images)
POST /api/jobs/ {mode: "i2v", ...} + 1 reference_audio file    -> 400 (i2v allows 0 audio refs)
POST /api/jobs/ {mode: "r2v", ...} + 4 reference_audio files   -> 400 (r2v allows at most 3 audio refs)
```

**Test at least one reference upload with a realistically-sized file (a
few MB, not a 1KB placeholder) through nginx specifically** — i.e. a real
`curl`/browser request to `http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/`, not just
Django's test `Client` (which talks to the view directly and never goes
through nginx at all). This isn't redundant with the size-cap checks above:
nginx's own `client_max_body_size` (`frontend/nginx.conf`) is a completely
separate limit in front of Django, and a real bug here — nginx's 1MB
default rejecting every reference upload with a `413`, before the request
ever reached Django — was invisible to every `Client`-based check in this
section and only showed up as a real submission failure. Any check that
only exercises Django directly can't catch an nginx-layer misconfiguration
like this.

### 1.7 Job listing/detail/delete + cross-user isolation

```
GET /api/jobs/               -> 200, only the logged-in user's own jobs, each
                                 including raw_prompt (list-level, not detail-only)
GET /api/jobs/<id>/           -> 200, full detail incl. raw_prompt/improved_prompt/
                                  error_message/references (list view omits the
                                  latter three)
GET /api/jobs/<id>/ (as a *different* user) -> 404
```

Deletion:

```
DELETE /api/jobs/<id>/ (status=processing)          -> 409, job untouched
DELETE /api/jobs/<id>/ (status=queued or done)      -> 204, row + its reference/
                                                        video files actually gone
DELETE /api/jobs/<id>/ (as a *different* user)      -> 404
```

Re-queue (the JobModal "⋯ More" -> Re-queue dialog, `count` default 1, max
10):

```
POST /api/jobs/<id>/requeue/ {"count": 2}           -> 201, a LIST of 2 new
                                                         detail-serialized jobs,
                                                         each status=queued with
                                                         the same
                                                         raw_prompt/improved_prompt/
                                                         megapixels/aspect_ratio/
                                                         width/height/
                                                         duration_seconds/
                                                         estimated_seconds/
                                                         use_spectrum/use_turbo
                                                         (plus steps on the row --
                                                         not in the response, see
                                                         the RequeueJobTests note)
                                                         and the same prompt_hash
                                                         as the original
                                                         (same prompt -> same
                                                         queue-list color line)
POST /api/jobs/<id>/requeue/ {}                     -> 201, exactly 1 copy
POST /api/jobs/<id>/requeue/ {"count": 0|11|"abc"}  -> 400
POST /api/jobs/<id>/requeue/ (as a *different* user) -> 404
```

For a job with reference files, confirm each copy's reference file is a
*copy*, not a link to the original: new path (different UUID), same
bytes, and deleting any one of the copies (or the original) leaves the
others' files intact. Also confirm the original job's row is untouched
(same title/favorite/archived, same reference count). As with §1.6, the
copies are real renders, so cancel them right after verifying (`POST
/api/jobs/<copy_id>/cancel/`) and then DELETE them all to keep the queue
and media volume clean. The original can 409 on DELETE for a few seconds
if process_queue() claimed it in the meantime (it's first in the FIFO
queue) -- cancelling a processing job is asynchronous, so retry after a
short pause (see the Deletion block above). The automated coverage for
all of the above lives in `backend/generation/tests.py::RequeueJobTests`
(Docker-run, see "Backend" below).

If testing via Django's test `Client` from `manage.py shell` rather than
real `curl`/browser requests, use `Client(SERVER_NAME='localhost')` —
the default `testserver` host isn't in `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, so every
request 400s with a generic Django error page that looks like a real bug
but isn't one (hit this for real writing this check).

### 1.8 FIFO / serialized processing (the part worth actually re-verifying,
not just trusting the code comments)

This works whether or not ComfyUI is reachable — an unreachable ComfyUI just
means each job fails fast, which is fine for a timing/ordering check:

1. Queue 3-4 jobs back to back (§1.6, any mode, cheap/draft preset).
2. Poll `GET /api/jobs/` every second or two until every job's
   `status == "done"`.
3. Confirm from the timestamps:
   - `started_at` order matches creation order (strict FIFO — no job starts
     out of turn).
   - No overlap: every job's `finished_at` is `<=` the next job's
     `started_at` (never two jobs `processing` at once).
   - Each job's `expected_finish_time`, captured **at creation time**,
     roughly equals the previous job's `expected_finish_time` plus this
     job's own `estimated_seconds` (small variance is fine; it's a live
     estimate, not a promise). A job created when the queue is empty may
     legitimately show `expected_finish_time: null` in its create response
     if it finishes before that same request's own lookup runs (only
     possible with near-instant failures, i.e. ComfyUI unreachable — not a
     bug, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Verification" section).

### 1.9 Invite management (staff only)

`GET`/`POST /api/invites/` and `DELETE /api/invites/<id>/` are gated by
`IsAdminUser` (`request.user.is_staff`), separate from the general session
auth gate in §1.2:

```
GET /api/invites/  (non-staff, logged in)      -> 403
POST /api/invites/ (non-staff, logged in)      -> 403
DELETE /api/invites/<id>/ (non-staff)          -> 403
GET /api/invites/  (staff)                     -> 200, list newest-first
POST /api/invites/ {expires_in_days: 7} (staff) -> 201, expires_at set to
                                                    ~7 days from now (server-
                                                    computed, not trusted
                                                    from the client)
DELETE /api/invites/<id>/ (staff)              -> 204, row actually gone
```

Also confirm `GET /api/me/` includes `is_staff: true`/`false` matching the
logged-in user — the frontend's Admin nav link and `/manage` client-side
redirect both key off this field (the real gate is still `IsAdminUser`
above, this is UX only).

### 1.10 Quality/duration catalog management (staff only)

`generation/admin_api.py`'s 6 endpoints, also `IsAdminUser`-gated. Only
the `sort_order` field on `RenderPreset` is schema-backed (migration
`0013`) — a "quality level" is still every `RenderPreset` row sharing one
`label` across modes; "removing" anything is always `is_active: false`,
never a real delete (both models are `PROTECT`ed by `GenerationJob`).
Labels aren't fixed — the live catalog's original "Standard" has already
been renamed to "Lowest" through real use of this tool, so don't assume
any specific label name still exists; use `GET /api/quality-catalog/`
first to pick a real one for `copy_durations_from`/etc. below.

```
GET /api/quality-catalog/ (non-staff)  -> 403
GET /api/quality-catalog/ (staff)      -> 200, "levels" has one entry per
                                           distinct label (6 in the seeded
                                           catalog), each with a "modes"
                                           dict; "durations" has one entry
                                           per distinct duration_seconds
POST /api/quality-levels/
  {label, is_draft, modes: {t2v: {megapixels, steps}},
   copy_durations_from: "<an existing label>"}     -> 201; the new
                                           preset's durations were
                                           actually cloned from the source
                                           label's active ones (check via
                                           the ORM, not just the response)
POST /api/quality-levels/ {label: "<existing label, different case>", ...}
                                        -> 400 (case-insensitive collision)

                                           one call, old label now 404s

                                           new RenderDuration rows were
                                           created and no is_active values

**Before testing `apply: true` against a real mode**: snapshot every
`RenderDuration.estimated_render_seconds` for that mode to a file first
(`{d.id: d.estimated_render_seconds for d in RenderDuration.objects.
filter(preset__mode=mode)}`, copied out of the container, not just to
`/tmp` where a container restart loses it) and restore from that exact
snapshot afterward. `apply` is necessarily mode-wide (it has to touch
every level to be useful), so testing it against a real mode's real data
without a snapshot **will** contaminate real catalog numbers with
synthetic test data — this actually happened once and had to be recovered
from the documented seed formula rather than an exact backup. Prefer testing
against a mode with no real completed-job history if one exists, or take
the snapshot regardless.

**Real bug to watch for if this ever needs re-touching**: don't compute
distinct duration values via `RenderDuration.objects.values_list(
"duration_seconds", flat=True).distinct()` -- `RenderPreset.Meta.
ordering` bleeds into the JOIN's implicit `ORDER BY`, and Postgres then
requires those columns in the `SELECT` list for `DISTINCT` to be valid,
silently returning one row per `(duration_seconds, sort_order, mode,
megapixels)` combination instead (342 rows instead of 19, in the seeded
catalog) -- `.count()` on the same queryset looks correct even when
iterating it doesn't, so check the actual row count, not just `.count()`.
Both `_serialize_catalog()` and the estimate endpoint dedupe in Python
over already-fetched values instead, which sidesteps it.

Frontend check (§2 below) covers the UI on top of this — the API checks
here are enough on their own to confirm the batch semantics (clone-on-
create, rename-updates-every-mode, reactivate-reuses-prior-estimate,
upsert-on-new-duration, reorder-matches-exact-label-set) work independent
of any rendering concerns.

### 1.11 Cleanup

Delete the throwaway user (cascades to their `GenerationJob`/
`ReferenceAsset`/`PromptChatSession` rows) and any `RenderPreset` you
created solely for testing. Don't leave test data in a shared environment.
(Individual test jobs can also be cleaned up one at a time via
`DELETE /api/jobs/<id>/`, §1.7 above, rather than deleting the whole user —
useful if you want to keep the throwaway user around across runs.)

## 2. Frontend check (real browser)

Requires an actual browser session (Playwright or by hand) — I don't have
direct browser tooling in every context, so either drive this manually or
via an agent/skill that does (this project's `run` skill, if invoked,
handles exactly this). Point it at `http://localhost:8080/` (or whatever
`frontend`'s published port is).

1. **Logged out**: `/` shows the login screen, not a blank page or an
   error. If `oidc_enabled` is `false`, no OIDC button renders — just the
   `/accounts/login/` link. If `true`, the OIDC button is present and its
   label matches `oidc_provider_name`.
2. **Login**: via `/accounts/login/` (admin-created account) or the OIDC
   button. Lands back on the SPA — **not** a 404 at `/accounts/profile/**`
   (a real bug hit and fixed in an earlier pass; regressions here are easy
   to reintroduce by touching `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` in `config/settings.py`).
3. **Nav**: logged in shows the page title/brand and a "Log out" link with
   the username. A staff user (`is_staff: true`) additionally sees
   "Generate"/"Admin" nav links; a non-staff user sees neither (Generate
   and the queue are one persistent layout at `/`, not a separate page, so
   there's nothing to link to until Admin exists). Confirm a non-staff user
   who manually navigates to `/manage` gets redirected back to `/` and
   never sees the Admin link render.
4. **Generate screen** (`/`, page `<title>` is "Minimax H3 Generator"):
   - **Content-type tabs**: `Video` shown selected; `Image`/`Audio` present
     but disabled (no such generation pipeline exists — this is intentional,
     see §3 below, not a bug).
   - **Mode tabs** (t2v/i2v/r2v): switching changes which reference-upload
     UI shows below (none / two explicit slots / dynamic add-list).
   - **Toolbar** (quality/aspect-ratio/length): all three load and
     auto-select sane defaults (a non-draft quality tier,
     `default_aspect_ratio` from `/api/config/`, the slider's own default
     duration); the length slider's available steps update when the quality
     tier changes (each tier has its own `durations` list); the displayed
     estimate below the form updates when quality, ratio, or length
     changes.
   - **Prompt** is the visually dominant fieldset (larger textarea,
     autofocused). If `llm_enabled`, "AI refine" and "Chat with AI" are
     visible on it; if not, neither is.
5. **Reference flow**:
   - i2v: attach a first-frame image, optionally a last-frame image — each
     shows a local thumbnail preview once picked.
   - r2v: add 2+ reference images via the dynamic list (each gets a small
     thumbnail), use "Insert token" on one and confirm it writes
     `<Picture N>` into the prompt textarea at the cursor, then remove one
     and confirm the list updates. Separately, add 1+ reference audio files
     via their own dynamic list (filename shown, no thumbnail) and confirm
     "Insert token" writes `<Audio N>`.
6. **Submit**: fill a prompt, pick quality/ratio/length, submit (see §0's
   note on this potentially reaching real ComfyUI if it's reachable). No
   modal, no navigation — the form just resets and the job shows up in the
   sidebar (step 7) on its own; submitting must **not** pop anything up.
7. **Queue sidebar + job modal**: the always-visible sidebar on the right
   shows the new job with a title derived from its prompt (first ~40
   chars), and its status updates without a manual refresh. Clicking an
   entry opens its modal: prompt, resolution/length, render time, and —
   once `done` with a `video_url` — the video playing inline (not a 404 —
   `/media/` must be reachable through nginx, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s
   "Verification" section for the bug this used to have) plus a working
   Download link. A `done` job with no `video_url` (i.e. it errored) shows
   a red "Failed" state, not a successful one, and the modal's own
   `error_message` text explains why. The sidebar entry itself also gets a
   small video thumbnail once done. Confirm **Delete** removes the entry
   from the sidebar and closes the modal (disabled with an explanatory
   tooltip while the job is `processing` — matches the API's 409, see
   §1.7). Confirm **Redo** repopulates the Generate form's mode/ratio/
   prompt/AI-refined-prompt/length *and* re-attaches its reference images
   and audio (re-fetched from their own media URLs and restored into the
   right slots/order — i2v's first/last frame, r2v's image and audio
   lists, thumbnails included) — this used to be a documented limitation
   but is now expected to actually work; a job with references that come
   back empty after Redo is a real bug, not the known non-failure it once
   was.
8. **Console**: zero unexpected errors in the browser dev console across
   all of the above (network 4xx/5xx you *intentionally* triggered while
   testing validation don't count).
9. **Admin: Invites tab** (`/manage/invites`, staff only — see step 3,
   default landing tab for `/manage`): create an invite (email optional,
   expiry Never/7/30 days), confirm it appears in the list with an
   "Active" status badge and the expected created/expires metadata. "Copy
   link" writes `<origin>/invite/<token>/` to the clipboard (shows
   "Copied!" briefly). "Revoke" removes it from the list immediately
   regardless of redeemed state. Empty list shows the empty-state message,
   not a blank area.
10. **Admin: Quality & Duration tab** (`/manage/catalog`): confirm the
    quality-levels table shows one row per distinct label, each with a
    two-row header (`Label`/`Draft` spanning both, then `MP`/`Steps`/
    `Active` sub-columns per mode) and every sub-column's body cell
    aligned directly under its header — not stacked in a single column (a
    real bug here was caused by `display: flex` on a `<td>` breaking table
    layout; if it recurs the symptom is every mode's data appearing under
    the first mode column with the others empty — verify with
    `getBoundingClientRect()` on header vs. body cells, not just a
    screenshot). Rename a level inline (blur commits it, every mode's row
    renamed together). Toggle a mode's "active" checkbox off — it must
    visually uncheck **immediately** on click, not lag or silently revert
    (the checkboxes here use local optimistic state for exactly this
    reason). **Reorder**: click a row's ▲/▼ buttons and confirm adjacent
    rows swap and the new order survives a reload; drag a row's ⠿ handle
    onto another row and confirm the same — this is also the order the
    quality dropdown uses on the Generate screen (`/`), worth spot-checking
    too. In the durations table, toggle a cell off then on for an existing
    duration/level/mode combination and confirm the estimate persists
    across a reload; use "Add a duration value" with a range like "21-25"
    and confirm the new rows appear immediately client-side (before any
    are actually saved), then check one cell to confirm it becomes a real
    persisted row. Use "Add quality level" to create one spanning at least
    one mode with "copy durations from" set, and confirm it isn't born
    with a "0 durations" warning badge. Click one of the three mode
    buttons in the "Estimate from completed jobs" toolbar above the
    durations table and confirm the (wider, `.modal-wide`) estimate modal
    opens showing either a real fitted curve/charts or a clear "not
    enough completed jobs yet" message (most modes won't have 2+ distinct
    workload values without seeding synthetic completed jobs first across
    2+ presets, see §1.10 — expected, not a bug). When data exists,
    confirm: both SVG charts render points at sane, in-viewBox coordinates
    (check via the DOM — `circle` `cx`/`cy` attributes — not just a
    screenshot, the same discipline that caught the `display:flex`-on-`
    <td>` bug); points use more than one color when multiple levels are
    represented; the legend and the Level/Duration/Current/Fitted table
    both list multiple levels, not just one; "Apply" round-trips into the
    durations table after a reload. **Read the snapshot-before-testing
    warning in §1.10 before clicking Apply against a mode with real
    history** — it mutates real catalog rows for every level of that
    mode.
11. **Mobile viewport** (~390×844): repeat steps 4-7 and, for a staff
    user, 9 (the Quality & Duration tab is a dense desktop-oriented power
    tool and is deliberately out of scope for mobile polish). Specifically
    confirm: the mode tab strip scrolls horizontally within itself rather
    than overflowing the page; the nav wraps the username/logout onto its
    own row rather than pushing it off-screen
    (`document.documentElement.scrollWidth` should equal the viewport
    width — a real bug here was caught by exactly this check); the job
    modal is usable as a near-full-screen sheet, not a cramped dialog with
    wasted margin.

## 3. Known-expected non-failures

- **A queued job ends `done` with `error_message` set, no `video_url`** —
  correct behavior when ComfyUI isn't reachable at the configured
  `COMFYUI_BASE_URL`, or a submitted job is otherwise invalid on ComfyUI's
  side. Only worth investigating if ComfyUI *is* confirmed reachable (§0)
  and the failure message doesn't explain itself.
- **`expected_finish_time: null` on a job's create response** — see §1.8,
  point 3. Only a bug if it happens with a real (non-instant) render.
- **No OIDC button** — expected whenever `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` is unset in
  `.env`; not a bug, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Backend apps" section.
- **`Image`/`Audio` content-type tabs are disabled and do nothing when
  clicked** — expected; no image/audio-only generation pipeline exists in
  this backend yet, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Deferred" section.

## 4. Real ComfyUI render (optional, separate from the rest of this check)

Everything above is safe to run any time — nothing in §1-3 spends real GPU
time even when ComfyUI is reachable, since job *creation* always succeeds
regardless of whether the eventual render does. Actually letting a job reach
ComfyUI and render for real is the one thing genuinely worth calling out
separately: it costs real time on real hardware and, per
`ARCHITECTURE.md`'s benchmarking notes, an oversized combination has been
observed to crash the ComfyUI process itself. Confirm `COMFYUI_BASE_URL`
points at a real, currently-reachable instance (§0), pick the cheapest
available preset (`is_draft: true`), and get an explicit go-ahead before
queuing it — don't fold this into a routine function check by default.
